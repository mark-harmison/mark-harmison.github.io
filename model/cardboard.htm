<h1>Cardboard Model</h1>
<p>On the suggestion of one of the architect's we interviewed, we built a scale model of the design out of cardboard.
While it was moderately useful for visualizing the interior, it was much more useful for visualizing the exterior.  We
made two different sizes for the cupola, thinking perhaps a wider one would look a little nicer.  In the end we went
with one about the same size as the original house.</p>
<p>Another thing the model was useful for was seeing how the sun light beamed down from the second floor windows into
the stair way.  It should be very pretty in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It took us several hours to build the model, but not as long as you might think, and it was fun.</p>
