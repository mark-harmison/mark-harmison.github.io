<div><a name="SPENDM11"></a><h1>Change the Interest Rate Structure for Student Loans</h1>

<p>The federal government operates several loan programs to
help students and their parents pay for postsecondary
education. The terms and eligibility for loans made under
those programs vary widely. Subsidized loans feature
interest forgiveness while students are enrolled and for six
months after they leave school, but those loans are available
only to those with demonstrated financial need.
Unsubsidized loans, without interest forgiveness, are
available to any student regardless of need. PLUS loans
are available to parents of dependent students and to
graduate and professional students; their terms are similar
to those of unsubsidized loans, except that interest rates
are higher. Regardless of the type of loan, borrowers benefit
from few or no requirements with respect to credit history
or collateral and from repayment options that take
into account the borrowers' financial circumstances.</p>

<p>Currently, the interest rate on all new unsubsidized and
subsidized loans to nonundergraduate students is 6.8 percent.
On all new PLUS loans, the interest rate is 7.9 percent.
For the 2011-2012 academic year, the interest rate
on new subsidized loans to undergraduate students will
be 3.4 percent, but for all subsequent years, that rate will
be 6.8 percent because of the expiration of a provision in
the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007.</p>

<p>This option would change the structure of interest rates
on federal student and parent loans to resemble those on
fixed-rate mortgage loans. In particular, the interest rate
on new loans would depend on conditions in financial
markets at the time of origination but remain fixed for
the life of the loan. Under this option, the interest rate on
all new federal student and parent loans would be set to
the interest rate on 10-year Treasury notes at the beginning
of the academic year in which the loan is originated
plus 3 percentage points. This option would reduce federal
outlays by $900 million from 2012 to 2016 and by
$52 billion from 2012 to 2021, the Congressional Budget
Office estimates. (The Federal Credit Reform Act of
1990 requires that the federal budget record all costs and
collections associated with a new loan in the year in
which the loan is disbursed.)</p>

<p>The large jump in savings between the first and second
halves of the 10-year estimating window reflects CBO's
projections of a steady increase in Treasury interest rates
over the first few years of the 2012-2021 period. Initially,
interest rates on certain student loans under this option
would be lower than under current policies, generating
some costs for the government. As interest rates rise, however,
the rates on student loans under this option would
grow to be higher than under current policies, generating
large savings.</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that it would focus the loan
programs' role on providing access to financing for all
students at an interest rate not generally available to borrowers
who have neither a demonstrated credit history
nor collateral. (The Federal Pell Grant Program would
continue to provide tuition relief to students with the
greatest financial need.) In addition, the interest rate on
student and parent loans would adjust to conditions in
financial markets at the time a loan was originated, making
the government subsidy equally valuable in relatively
high and relatively low interest rate environments. However,
borrowers would continue to benefit from predictable
monthly payments because of the fixed interest rate
over the life of a loan.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that, given CBO's
projections of the interest rates on 10-year Treasury notes
from 2012 to 2021, the option would raise the expected
average interest rate on student and parent loans. Consequently,
for most loans, the interest accrued and monthly
payments when borrowers left school would be greater
than under current policies. The anticipation of higher
debt payments might limit the fields of study students
would consider and the types of jobs they would seek.
Also, borrowers who were in school during times of tight
financial markets would pay higher interest rates than
borrowers who were in school during other times.</p>
