<div><a name="SPENDD20"></a><h1>Limit Highway Funding to Expected Highway Revenues</h1>

<p>The Federal-Aid Highways Program provides grants to
states for highway and other surface transportation projects.
The last reauthorization for the highway program--
the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation
Equity Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-59)--expired in
2009 and has been temporarily extended several times
since then. Highway funding is provided as contract
authority, a type of mandatory budget authority. However,
most spending from the program is controlled by
annual limitations on obligations set in appropriation
acts.</p>

<p>Historically, most of the funding for highway programs
has come from the Highway Trust Fund, which has two
accounts. In 2010, the fund's highway account spent
$32.0 billion and was credited with $30.2 billion in
revenues. The fund also includes a mass transit account.
Revenues credited to both accounts are generated by the
federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as other
federal taxes related to highway transportation. Since
2001, outlays from the highway account have been outpacing
revenues credited to it by an average of about
$2.8 billion per year. Because of that gap, the Congress
has supplemented revenues dedicated to the trust fund
with three separate transfers totaling $29.7 billion from
the Treasury's general fund. In addition, the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5)
appropriated $27.5 billion for highway programs from
the general fund. About half of that amount--$14.2 billion--
was spent in 2009 and 2010; the Congressional
Budget Office estimates that the remaining amount will
be spent over the next several years.</p>

<p>This option would reduce federal funding for the highway
system, starting in fiscal year 2012, by lowering the
obligation limitation for the Federal-Aid Highways
Program to the amount of projected revenues going to
the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund. The
federal taxes that directly fund the Highway Trust Fund
would not change. CBO estimates that this option would
reduce resources provided for the highway program by
almost $48 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by
about $108 billion over 10 years. Outlays would decrease
by about $33 billion over the 2012-2016 period and
$86 billion over the 2012-2021 period, CBO estimates.</p>

<p>A key rationale for this option is that federal funding for
highways should come from highway users, not general
taxpayers: first, because it is fairer if those who benefit
from government spending pay for those benefits; and
second, because resources are allocated most efficiently
when beneficiaries pay and will therefore consider those
user costs when determining their behavior. In that view,
if the Congress believes that higher levels of federal support
for highways are appropriate, it should increase the
taxes that are credited to the Highway Trust Fund.</p>

<p>Another rationale for this option is that shifting more
responsibility for highway construction and maintenance
costs to the states not only would give the states stronger
incentives to focus on projects with the greatest net benefits
but also could reduce the substitution of federal
spending for spending by state and local governments.
(The Government Accountability Office reported in
2004 that the existence of federal highway grants has
encouraged state and local governments to reduce their
own spending on highways and to allocate those funds
for other uses.) Supporters of this option might also contend
that the revenues credited to the highway account of
the trust fund are sufficient to fund an appropriate share
of all highway projects with true interstate significance--
and those are the projects that should be the primary
responsibility of the federal government.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that the government
should spend more on roads and bridges to offset the
effects of aging and increased traffic. Federal support for
the road network as a whole is appropriate, moreover,
because even local roads support interstate commerce and
strengthen the national economy--for example, by
allowing Internet retailers to operate with large economies
of scale. Another argument against this option is
that the use of general taxpayer funds to supplement
trust fund revenues from highway users is appropriate
because money from the Highway Trust Fund is spent
on nonhighway projects and purposes, such as public
transit, sidewalks, bike paths, recreational trails, scenic
beautification, and preservation of historic transportation
structures.</p>
