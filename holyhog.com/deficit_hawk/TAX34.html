<p>The Superfund program and its associated trust fund
were established in 1981 to clean up the nation's worst
hazardous waste sites. By statute, the cost of cleanup is to
be borne by the parties responsible for the contamination,
but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
which administers the program, pays for the cleanup
when liable parties cannot be identified, no longer exist,
or are unwilling or unable to undertake the job.</p>

<p>EPA-led cleanups and other Superfund activities are
funded by an annual appropriation, which lawmakers
designate as having two sources: One portion comes from
the general fund of the Treasury, and the other portion
is drawn from balances in the program's trust fund. In
2010, the total appropriation was $1.3 billion, and net
outlays were $1.0 billion.</p>

<p>Originally, revenues designated for the trust fund were
derived mainly from taxes on petroleum and various
industrial chemicals and from a corporate environmental
income tax. However, authorization for those taxes
expired in December 1995. The trust fund continues to
receive some money from liable parties who pay interest
and penalties and reimburse EPA for its cleanup costs;
but the program is now financed largely from the general
fund.</p>

<p>This option would reinstate the taxes that expired at the
end of 1995: the Superfund excise tax of 9.7 cents per
barrel of crude oil or refined oil product, an excise tax of
$0.22 to $4.87 per ton on various chemicals, and a corporate
income tax of 0.12 percent on corporations' modified
alternative minimum taxable income above $2 million.
(The latter is computed by disallowing certain tax
preferences allowed under the regular corporate income
tax and by making other adjustments, both positive and
negative, to the firm's taxable income.) Together, those
taxes would yield revenues of $9 billion between 2012
and 2016 and $19 billion from 2012 through 2021.
(Because excise taxes reduce the tax base of income and
payroll taxes, additional excise taxes would lead to reductions
in revenue from income and payroll taxes. The estimates
shown here reflect those reductions.)</p>

<p>An argument in favor of the option is that reauthorizing
the dedicated taxes to finance the Superfund program,
rather than continuing to rely on general funds, is more
consistent with the principle that entities that contribute
to pollution should pay to clean up the resulting problems.
Because petroleum products and various chemical
feedstocks and derivatives are common sources of contamination
at Superfund sites, and because hazardous
chemicals are used by many medium-sized and large corporations,
having producers and users of those substances--
as well as corporations more broadly--pay
much of the cleanup bill would be fairer than having all
taxpayers bear those costs. A second rationale is that having
a stable source of funding would help maintain EPA's
long-term efforts at the worst sites and continue to give
responsible parties reason for concern that EPA will conduct
its own cleanups and seek to recover the costs from
them if they do not undertake the work themselves.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that taxing all companies
in an industry or all corporations above a particular
size, regardless of those companies' past or current waste-
disposal practices, would not provide incentives for
companies to handle waste carefully or, in fact, to avoid
creating it in the first place. Instead, companies would be
subject to the tax without regard to their role in creating
future hazardous waste sites. The tax would distort economic
decisions, thus hampering rather than promoting
efficiency. Another argument against the option is that it
could unfairly tax current stakeholders of a business (its
customers, employees, and investors) who were not
responsible for and did not benefit from earlier polluting
activities.</p>

<p>A third argument against the option is that some research spending (including spending from the trust fund) has
indicates that the administrative and compliance costs of always been subject to annual appropriations, dedicated
such levies are out of proportion with the relatively small taxes would provide no guarantee of stable funding.
amounts of revenue they raise. Also, because Superfund</p>
