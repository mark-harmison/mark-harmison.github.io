<p>Individuals may pursue civil claims against physicians,
hospitals, and other health care providers for alleged torts,
which are breaches of duty that result in personal injury.
That system of tort law has twin objectives: deterring
negligent behavior on the part of providers and compensating
claimants for losses they incur (including lost
wages, medical expenses, and pain and suffering) as the
result of an injury caused by negligence. Malpractice
claims are generally pursued through the state courts, and
states have established various rules by which those claims
are adjudicated. Nearly all health care providers obtain
malpractice insurance to protect against the risk of having
to pay a very large malpractice claim. The cost of that
insurance results in higher medical costs because, in order
to pay for the premiums, providers charge their patients
higher fees. Furthermore, research suggests that placing
limits on malpractice torts will reduce the quantity of
prescribed health care services by a small amount.</p>

<p>This option would impose certain nationwide curbs on
medical malpractice torts. Many states have enacted some
or all of these limits, whereas others have very few restrictions
on malpractice claims. The tort limits include caps
on noneconomic damages (also known as pain and suffering)
and on punitive damages; a shortened statute of
limitations; restrictions on the use of joint-and-several liability;
and changes to rules regarding collateral sources of
income.1 The specific components of medical malpractice
tort reform under this option are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
A cap of $250,000 on awards for noneconomic
damages;
</li>
<li>
A cap on awards for punitive damages of $500,000 or
two times the value of awards for economic damages,
whichever is greater;
</li>
<li>
A statute of limitations of one year from the date of
discovery of the injury for adults, and three years for
children;
</li>
<li>
A fair-share rule (replacing the rule of joint-andseveral
liability) under which a defendant in a lawsuit
would be liable only for the percentage of the final
award that was equal to that defendant's share of
responsibility for the injury; and
</li>
<li>
Permission to introduce evidence of income from
collateral sources (such as life insurance payouts and
health insurance) at trial.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Malpractice tort limits would reduce total health care
spending in two ways. First, by reducing the average size
of malpractice awards, tort limits would reduce the cost
of malpractice insurance premiums. That reduced cost of
malpractice insurance paid by providers would flow
through to health plans and patients in the form of lower
prices for health care services. Second, as noted above,
tort limits would also reduce utilization of health care services
by a small amount as practitioners prescribed somewhat
fewer services when faced with less pressure from
potential malpractice claims. In the estimation of the
Congressional Budget Office, the combined effect of
those two factors would be a reduction of about 0.5 percent
of total health care spending. For this option, CBO
assumed that a change enacted in October 2011 would
have an impact that increased over time, achieving its full
effect after four years, as providers gradually changed
their practice patterns. In terms of federal health care
spending, the percentage decline in spending for Medicare
is estimated to be larger than the decline in spending
for other federal health programs or for national health
spending. That estimate is based on empirical evidence
showing that the impact of tort reform on the use of
health care services is greater for Medicare than for the
rest of the health care system.</p>

<p>By reducing spending on health care in the private
sector, this option would also affect federal revenues.
Much private-sector health care is provided through
employment-based insurance that represents nontaxable
compensation. Because premiums paid by employers for
health insurance are excluded from employees' taxable
income, reducing such premiums would, on average,
increase the share of employees' compensation that was
taxable and thereby increase federal tax revenues by an
estimated $13 billion over the next 10 years.</p>

<p>This option would reduce mandatory spending for
Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance
Program, subsidies for coverage purchased through health
insurance exchanges, and the Federal Employees Health
Benefits program by a total of roughly $50 billion from
2012 to 2021. Discretionary savings would amount to
$400 million over the 2012-2016 period and $1.6 billion
over the 2012-2021 period, if the amounts appropriated
for federal agencies were reduced accordingly.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that it would
reduce spending for health care services. Another rationale
is that, by reducing premiums for medical malpractice
insurance, the option could help alleviate shortages
of certain types of physicians in some areas of the
country. For example, annual malpractice premiums for
obstetricians exceed $100,000 in some areas. Such high
premiums may deter some obstetricians from practicing
in those areas or from practicing at all.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that tort limits could
prevent those who have suffered substantial harm as a
result of medical negligence from obtaining full compensation
for their injuries. In addition, reducing the amount
of money that could be collected in the case of a medical
injury might cause providers to exercise less caution,
resulting in an increase in the number of medical injuries
attributable to negligence.</p>

<p>The evidence is mixed on whether tort limits have an
adverse effect on health outcomes. Some researchers who
have observed a reduction in the use of health care services
as the risk of litigation falls have also found that
reducing that risk produces a small increase in the mortality
rate. Another study found that reform of joint-andseveral
liability had positive impacts on health but caps
on noneconomic damages had negative impacts. Other
studies have concluded that tort limits have no effect on
mortality or other measures of health.</p>
