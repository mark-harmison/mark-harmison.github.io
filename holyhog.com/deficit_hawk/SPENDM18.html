<div><a name="SPENDM18"></a><h1>Raise the Age of Eligibility for Medicare to 67</h1>

<p>The usual age of eligibility for Medicare benefits is 65,
although certain people qualify for coverage earlier.
(Medicare is available to persons under age 65 who have
been eligible for disability benefits under Social Security
for at least 24 months and to those with end-stage renal
disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.) Because of
increases in life expectancy, the average length of time
that people are covered by Medicare has risen significantly
since the program began in 1965. That trend,
which increases the program's costs, is expected to
continue.</p>

<p>This option would raise the age of eligibility for Medicare
by two months every year beginning with people who
were born in 1949 (who will turn 65 in 2014) until the
eligibility age reached 67 for people born in 1960 (who
will turn 67 in 2027). Thereafter, the eligibility age
would remain at 67. Those increases are similar to those
already under way for Social Security's full retirement age
(FRA)--that is, the age at which workers become eligible
for full retirement benefits--except that scheduled
increases in the FRA include a 12-year period during
which the FRA remains at 66. (Unlike Medicare, with its
single eligibility age, Social Security allows workers to
receive a reduced retirement benefit as early as age 62.
The vast majority of the eligible population chooses to
claim Social Security benefits before reaching the FRA.)
The eligibility age for Medicare would remain below
Social Security's FRA until 2020, when both would be
age 66 for people born in 1954; from that point on, the
two would be identical.</p>

<p>By the Congressional Budget Office's estimates, this
option would reduce federal spending by about $18 billion
over the 2012-2016 period and by roughly $125 billion
over the 2012-2021 period. Those estimates primarily
reflect a reduction in federal spending on Medicare
and a slight reduction in outlays for Social Security retire
ment benefits. Those reductions would be partially offset
by an increase in federal spending on Medicaid and an
increase in federal subsidies to purchase health insurance
through the new insurance exchanges that are scheduled
to be established in 2014.</p>

<p>The option would reduce outlays for Social Security
retirement benefits by inducing some people to delay
their application for such benefits (some people apply for
Social Security benefits at the same time they apply for
Medicare) and by encouraging some people to delay
retirement to maintain their employment-based health
insurance coverage until they became eligible for Medicare.
The option could also affect the number of people
who apply for disability benefits; those effects are
expected to be quite small and are not included in this
estimate.</p>

<p>The increase in Medicare's eligibility age would boost federal
spending on Medicaid in two ways. First, some of the
people who were no longer receiving Medicare benefits
would have income below 138 percent of the federal poverty
level and would therefore sign up for and receive
Medicaid benefits instead. (Under current law, that
income threshold applies only to people under age 65,
but for this option CBO assumed that that age limit
would increase in tandem with the Medicare eligibility
age.) Second, people over 65 who would have been
enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid (those for whom
Medicaid pays Medicare's premiums and cost sharing,
and covers certain services not covered by Medicare)
would instead have Medicaid as their primary source
of coverage until they reached the new Medicare eligibility
age.</p>

<p>Subsidies for insurance coverage purchased in the new
health insurance exchanges would also increase under this
option because some of the people whose eligibility for
Medicare was delayed would receive those subsidies
instead.</p>

<p>Federal revenues under this option would decrease by a
small amount over the 2012-2021 period; however, those
effects are not included in this estimate. That decline in
revenues would occur primarily because some employees
and retirees whose eligibility for Medicare was delayed
would accept coverage through their employer instead.
(Active workers who are eligible for Medicare have the
option of accepting or rejecting coverage from their
employer; for those who accept such coverage, Medicare
is the secondary payer.) Most of the resulting increase in
employers' spending on health insurance would lead to
reductions in taxable wages for active workers or would
reduce employers' taxable profits; the remainder would
probably be passed along to enrollees in the form of
higher premiums. In addition, employers that provided
retiree coverage to former workers before they became eligible
for Medicare would incur higher costs to the extent
that they provided such coverage over a longer period.
Although the option could induce some employers to
reduce or eliminate such retiree coverage, no changes of
that sort are incorporated in this estimate. Federal revenues
also would be reduced because a small portion of
the subsidies provided through the health insurance
exchanges are tax expenditures rather than outlays. CBO
did not estimate any increase in tax revenues resulting
from workers who delay retirement because total employment
in the economy was assumed to remain unchanged;
that assumption is consistent with CBO's standard
approach to cost estimates.</p>

<p>By 2035, Medicare's spending under this option is estimated
to be about 7 percent below what it would be in
the absence of this policy change--5.5 percent of gross
domestic product rather than 5.9 percent. On the basis of
estimates for the 2012-2021 period, CBO anticipates
that about one-quarter of those Medicare savings would
be offset by the increases in federal spending described
above.</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that it would raise the eligibility
age for Medicare to accompany increases in life
expectancy. The option would restrain the growth of
spending for Medicare. In addition, a higher age threshold
for Medicare eligibility would reinforce the incentive
to delay retirement created by increases in Social Security's
FRA.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that it would shift
costs that are now paid by Medicare to individuals and to
employers that offer health insurance to their retirees.
States' spending on Medicaid would also be higher.</p>
