<div><a name="SPENDM29"></a><h1>Raise the Earliest Eligibility Age for Social Security</h1>

<p>
Although the full retirement age for Social Security beneficiaries
is now 66 and will rise to 67 for people born in
1960 and later, eligible workers may choose to receive
benefits at age 62. About 40 percent do so, and nearly all
claim benefits by 66. The age at which people claim benefits
affects the amount they receive monthly and the
duration of their benefits. People who claim benefits
before the full retirement age receive less each month, but
typically they receive benefits for a longer period; conversely,
people who wait to claim benefits until they are
older (up to age 70) receive higher monthly payments but
for fewer years. The adjustment for the age of claiming
benefits is currently actuarially fair, on average, so a person's
total lifetime benefits have an approximately equal
value regardless of the age at which he or she begins to
collect them.</p>

<p>This option would increase the earliest age of eligibility
by two months per year, beginning with people born in
1950 (who turn 62 in 2012); by 2025, the age would be
64 for people born in 1961 and later. The result is that
federal outlays would be reduced by about $33 billion
over five years and by nearly $144 billion through 2021.</p>

<p>Because this option would have little effect on lifetime
benefits for the average beneficiary, its main budgetary
effect would be a shift in the timing of outlays, which
would be slightly lower than under current law from
2012 to about 2035 and would be slightly higher thereafter.
There are three complicating factors, however. First,
a higher earliest eligibility age would induce some people
to work longer, increasing the size of the workforce and
boosting federal revenues from income and payroll taxes.
Second, the additional work would result in higher future
Social Security benefits, although the increase in benefits
would be smaller than the increase in revenues. The
10-year estimates for this option do not include those
two effects. Third, changing the earliest eligibility age
would have a small effect on the number of people who
applied and qualified for Social Security disability insurance
as well as on the timing of applications for disability
benefits. The estimates take that effect into account;
however, it does not significantly change the projected
savings.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of the option is that the older population
is becoming healthier and able to work longer and
therefore many people do not need benefits at as early an
age as workers did in the past. The change also would
increase annual benefits for some beneficiaries, reducing
poverty among older people. Under current law, the penalty
for claiming benefits early is increasing as the full
retirement age rises. For example, people born before
1938 who claimed benefits at age 62 received 80 percent
of the full benefit (the amount that they would have
received had they waited until the full retirement age).
That fraction is decreasing under current law, to 70 percent
for people born after 1959 who claim benefits at 62.
If the earliest age of eligibility was 64, all retirees would
receive at least 80 percent of their full monthly benefit.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that it would increase
financial hardship for some people who do not qualify for
Social Security disability benefits and would have to wait
until age 64 to claim retirement benefits. In addition,
forcing people with lower-than-average life expectancies
to delay claiming benefits would reduce their lifetime
benefits. For example, someone who died at 68 would
collect benefits for four years rather than six. And because
people with lower earnings tend to have shorter life
expectancies, they would be more likely to be harmed by
the change.</p>
