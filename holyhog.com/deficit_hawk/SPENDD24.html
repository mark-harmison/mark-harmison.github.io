<p>
Under the New Starts program, the Department of
Transportation funds the construction or expansion of
rail and other fixed-guideway systems--mass transit systems
that use exclusive or controlled rights of way. A
related program, Small Starts, makes discretionary grants
to public transportation capital projects that cost less
than $250 million and require less than $75 million in
federal funding. For 2010, the Congress appropriated a
total of $2 billion for both programs, of which $200 million
was designated for Small Starts.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate both the New Starts and the
Small Starts programs. The Congressional Budget Office
estimates that this option would save about $6 billion
over 5 years and $16 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>One rationale for ending the programs is that the
federal government should not be funding rail transit
systems because their benefits are primarily local. A
second rationale is that if the federal government is to
support local public transit, there is no reason to focus
on new rail transit systems, which tend to provide less
value per dollar spent than bus systems do. Bus systems
require much less capital and offer more flexibility in
the adjustment of schedules and routes to meet changing
demands. Even without New Starts, state and local
governments could use federal aid distributed by formula
grants (noncompetitive awards based on a formula) for
new rail projects if they determined, on the basis of local
circumstances, that those projects would make the best
use of the funds. In 2010, for example, the federal
government provided $8.4 billion in formula funding
for transit projects, of which about $4.1 billion was
allocated in broad "urbanized area" grants for existing
and new systems, and $1.6 billion was designated for
the maintenance and improvement of existing fixed-
guideway systems. The remaining $2.7 billion was
distributed among a variety of smaller grant programs.</p>

<p>One argument against this option is that the New Starts
program seeks to identify the most promising rail transit
projects from a long list of candidates. Many supporters
of rail transit systems contend that rail transit will
become increasingly valuable as gasoline prices continue
their long-term upward trend. They also assert that building
new roads does not alleviate urban congestion or pollution
but leads only to greater decentralization and
sprawl. New rail transit systems, by contrast, could help
channel future commercial and residential development
into corridors where public transportation is available,
offering people convenient, affordable, and reliable
transportation.</p>
