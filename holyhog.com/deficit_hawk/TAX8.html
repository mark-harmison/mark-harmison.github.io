<div><a name="TAX8"></a><h1>Include Employer-Paid Premiums for Income Replacement Insurance in Employees' Taxable Income</h1>

<p>Benefits that replace income for the unemployed, injured,
or disabled are currently subject to different tax treatments.
Whereas unemployment benefits are fully taxable,
benefits paid under workers' compensation programs
(for work-related injuries or illnesses) are tax-exempt.
Disability benefits (for non-work-related injuries) may be
taxable, depending on who paid the premiums for the
disability insurance. If the employer paid the premiums,
the benefits are taxable (although the recipient's tax liability
can be offset partly by special income tax credits for
elderly or disabled people). If the employee paid the premiums
out of after-tax income, the benefits are not taxed.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate existing taxes on income
replacement benefits but would include in employees'
taxable income the value of several taxes, premiums, and
other contributions paid by employers. Specifically, all
of the following would be subject to the individual
income tax and the payroll taxes for Social Security and
Medicare: the taxes that employers pay under the Federal
Unemployment Tax Act and to various state unemployment
programs; 60 percent of premiums that employers
pay for workers' compensation (excluding the 40 percent
that covers medical expenses); and the portion of insurance
premiums or contributions to pension plans that
employers pay to fund disability benefits. Together, those
changes would increase revenues by $136 billion from
2012 through 2016 and by $316 billion over the 2012-
2021 period. Over the long term, the gain in revenues
would result almost entirely from adding workers' compensation
premiums to taxable income. Including those
various items in employees' taxable income, and thus
in the wage base from which Social Security benefits are
calculated, also would increase federal spending for Social
Security. On net, the option would reduce federal budget
deficits by $135 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by
$312 billion from 2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>An advantage of this option is that it would treat different
kinds of income replacement insurance similarly and
thereby eliminate the somewhat arbitrary discrepancies
that currently exist. For example, people who are unable
to work because of an injury would not be taxed differently
on the basis of whether their injury was related to a
previous job. In addition, the option would spread the tax
burden among all workers covered by such insurance
rather than placing the burden solely on those who need
the benefits, as is presently the case with unemployment
insurance and employer-paid disability insurance.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of this option is that it would not eliminate
all disparities in the way income replacement benefits
are treated. For example, the income replacement
portion of adjudicated awards and out-of-court settlements
for injuries not related to work and not covered
by insurance would remain entirely exempt from taxation.
Also, recipients of the supplemental unemployment
benefits that the government sometimes provides
during economic downturns would receive those benefits
tax-free, even though no amount corresponding to an
employer's contribution had ever been included in the
recipients' taxable income.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of the option is that it would
initially exempt from taxation the benefits received by
people whose premiums were not taxed, providing particularly
large benefits to that cohort relative to earlier
or subsequent cohorts. Transition rules could be devised
to limit or prevent such gains, but those rules would
probably be complicated and difficult to implement.</p>

<p>The option would reduce nearly every worker's take-
home pay but by a relatively small amount--less than
one-half of one percent, on average. For some workers,
that reduction in after-tax income would be somewhat
mitigated because any unemployment benefit or
employer-financed disability insurance, received at some
future date, would no longer be taxable.</p>
