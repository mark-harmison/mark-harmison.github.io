<div><a name="TAX20"></a><h1>Repeal the "LIFO" and "Lower of Cost or Market" Inventory Accounting Methods</h1>

<p>To compute its taxable income, a business must first
deduct from its receipts the cost of purchasing or producing
the goods it sold during the year. Determining those
costs requires that the business identify and attach a value
to its inventory. Most companies calculate the cost of the
goods they sell in a year using the accrual method of
accounting, adding the value of the inventory at the
beginning of the year to the cost of goods purchased or
produced during the year and then subtracting from that
total the value of the inventory at the end of the year.</p>

<p>The tax code allows firms to choose among several
approaches for identifying and determining the value of
the goods included in their inventory. For itemizing and
valuing goods in stock, firms can use the "specific identification"
method. That approach, however, requires a
very detailed physical accounting in which each item in
inventory is matched to its actual cost. An alternative
approach--"last in, first out" (LIFO)--also allows firms
to value their inventory at cost but, in addition, permits
them to assume that the last goods added to inventory
were the first ones sold. Under that assumption, the cost
of those more recently produced goods should approximate
current market value (that is, the cost of replacing
the inventory).</p>

<p>Yet another alternative approach--"first in, first out"
(FIFO)--is based on the assumption that the first goods
sold from a business's inventory have been in that inventory
the longest. Like firms that adopt the LIFO method,
firms using the FIFO approach can also value their goods
at cost. But firms that use the FIFO approach have still
another choice--the "lower of cost or market" (LCM)
method. Instead of assessing their existing inventory at
cost, they can assess that inventory on the basis of its market
value and then choose whichever valuation is lower.
In addition, if a business's goods cannot be sold at market
prices because they are damaged or flawed, firms that use
the FIFO approach can qualify for the "subnormal
goods" method of inventory valuation.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate the LIFO method of identifying
inventory, as well as the LCM and subnormal-
goods methods of inventory valuation. Businesses would
be required to use the specific-identification or FIFO
methods to account for goods in their inventory and to
set the value of that inventory on the basis of cost. Those
changes--which would be phased in over a period of
four years--would increase revenues by $72 billion from
2012 through 2016 and by a total of $98 billion over the
2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>The main rationale for this option is to align the tax
accounting rules with how businesses probably sell their
goods. Under many circumstances, firms probably prefer
to sell their oldest inventory first--among other reasons,
to minimize the risk that the product becomes obsolete or
damaged during storage. Under those circumstances,
allowing firms to use alternative methods to identify and
to value their inventories for tax purposes allows them to
reduce their tax liabilities without any change in their
economic behavior.</p>

<p>An argument for eliminating the LIFO method is that
it allows companies to defer taxes on real (inflationadjusted)
gains when the prices of their goods are rising
relative to general prices. Firms that use LIFO can assume
that the goods that are sold are from newer--and
costlier--inventory when, in fact, the items may have
been in inventory for some time and were produced
when costs were lower. By deducting those higher costs as
the price of production, firms are able to defer taxes on
the amount by which the value of their goods has appreciated,
until those goods are sold.</p>

<p>An argument against disallowing the LIFO accounting
method is that such a policy change could also result in
the taxation of income that arises from inflation. The
gains that would be taxed if the LIFO method was terminated
could be attributable to inflation and, therefore,
would not represent real changes in a firm's resources and
its ability to pay taxes. However, other elements of the
corporate income tax do not correct for inflation and
therefore gains attributable to inflation are taxed.</p>

<p>An argument for eliminating the LCM method of inventory
valuation under FIFO is that, when prices are falling,
it provides a tax advantage for goods that have not
been sold. The LCM method allows a business to compare
the market value of each item in its inventory with
the item's cost and then set the lower of the two as the
item's value. The year-end inventory will have a lower
total value under LCM than under the cost method if the
market value of any item in the inventory is less than its
cost. Using the LCM method when prices are falling
allows the firm to claim a larger deduction for the costs of
goods sold, causing the firm's taxable income to fall as a
result. In effect, that method allows a firm to deduct from
its taxable income the losses it incurred from the decline
in the value of its inventory. (That deduction is allowed
even though the firm has not sold the goods.) A firm,
however, is not required to recognize gains in the value
of its inventory when prices are rising, which means that
gains and losses are taxed differently. Similarly, firms that
use the subnormal goods method of inventory valuation
can immediately deduct the loss, even if the company
later sells the good at a profit.</p>
