<div><a name="TAX1"></a><h1>Increase Individual Income Tax Rates</h1>

<p>
Under current law, ordinary taxable income earned by
most individuals through 2012 will be taxed at the following
six statutory rates: 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent,
28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent. (Income
from long-term capital gains, which is taxed under a separate
schedule, is excluded from ordinary income. For tax
years 2011 and 2012 only, dividends are also excluded
from ordinary income because they are subject to a separate
rate schedule for those years.) After 2012, those rates
are scheduled to revert to the rates that were in effect
before 2001: 15 percent, 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent,
and 39.6 percent. The lower rates were originally
enacted in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2001 and were scheduled to expire at the
end of 2010. They were extended for two years by the
Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization,
and Job Creation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-312).</p>

<p>Under the tax code, different tax rates apply at different
levels of ordinary taxable income. (Taxable income generally
is gross income minus allowable adjustments, exemptions,
and deductions.) Tax brackets--the income ranges
to which the different rates apply--vary depending on
whether a taxpayer files singly or jointly. (See the table on
page 140 for a list of the six tax brackets for both single
and joint filers and the corresponding statutory tax rates.)
In 2011, for example, a person filing singly with taxable
income of $40,000 would pay a tax rate of 10 percent on
the first $8,500 of taxable income, 15 percent on the next
$26,000, and 25 percent on the remaining $5,500 of taxable
income. The starting points for those income ranges
are indexed to increase with inflation each year. Taxpayers
who are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT)
face statutory rates of 26 percent and 28 percent. (Federal
tax liability is computed differently under the AMT than
it is under the regular income tax because the former
allows a more limited set of exemptions, deductions, and
tax credits; taxpayers pay the higher of their regular tax or
the AMT.)</p>

<p>Income from long-term capital gains is taxed under a
separate rate schedule, with a maximum statutory rate of
15 percent; that rate will remain in effect through 2012
and then rise to 20 percent in ensuing years. Income from
dividends is currently subject to the same rate schedule
that applies to long-term capital gains; however, after
2012, dividends will be taxed as ordinary income.1</p>

<p>This option includes four alternative approaches for
increasing statutory rates under the individual income
tax. Those approaches are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Raise all tax rates on ordinary income (income subject
to the regular rate schedule) by 1 percentage point.
Consistent with current law, this option would not
apply to dividends earned in 2012.</li>
<li>
Raise all ordinary tax rates and AMT rates by 1 percentage
point.</li>
<li>
Raise all ordinary tax rates, AMT rates, and the separate
rates on dividends and capital gains by 1 percentage
point.</li>
<li>
Raise the top tax rate, the top two tax rates, or the top
three tax rates on ordinary income by 1 percentage
point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Raising all statutory tax rates on ordinary income by
1 percentage point would increase revenues by a total of
$208 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by $480 billion
from 2012 through 2021. If this alternative was
implemented, for example, the top rate of 35 percent that
is scheduled to be in effect in 2012 under current law
would increase to 36 percent; and the top rate of
39.6 percent that is scheduled to be in effect starting in
2013 would increase to 40.6 percent. Rates for the AMT
would remain the same as they are under current law.
Thus, the impact on revenues of raising all ordinary tax
rates would diminish over time relative to the size of the
economy because, under current law, a greater share of
taxpayers would become subject to the AMT and therefore
would not be affected by the increase in regular rates.</p>

<p>Raising AMT rates along with all of the regular tax rates by
1percentage point would increase revenues by $291 billion
from 2012 through 2016 and by $702 billion over
the 2012-2021 period. Unlike the first approach, this
alternative would impose higher rates on all ordinary
taxable income, regardless of whether those rates were
applied according to the regular or AMT schedule. Consequently,
the amount of additional revenues would not
be greatly affected by the growing number of taxpayers
subject to the AMT because those taxpayers would face
higher statutory tax rates, too.</p>

<p>If, in addition to raising the ordinary and AMT rates, lawmakers
boosted the separate tax rates on capital gains and
dividends by 1 percentage point, federal revenues would
increase by a total of $295 billion over the next five years
and by $715 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>Alternatively, lawmakers could target specific individual
income tax rates. For example, boosting only the top statutory
rate on ordinary income by 1 percentage point would
raise revenues by $30 billion from 2012 through 2016
and by $84 billion over the 10-year period. Because most
people who are subject to the top rate in the ordinary
schedule are not subject to the alternative minimum tax,
the AMT would not significantly limit the effect of that
increase in regular tax rates. Raising the rates for the top
two or three brackets would generate more revenues.</p>

<p>As a way to boost revenues, an increase in tax rates would
offer some administrative advantages over other types of
tax increases because it would require only relatively
minor changes to the current tax system. Rate hikes also
would have drawbacks, however. Higher tax rates would
reduce people's incentive to work and save. In addition, from taxable to nontaxable or tax-deferred forms. (Such a
