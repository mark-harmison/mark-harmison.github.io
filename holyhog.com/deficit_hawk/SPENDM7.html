<div><a name="SPENDM7"></a><h1>Reduce by 20 Percentage Points the Share of a Farmer's Base Acreage Eligible for USDA Payments</h1>

<p>The Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) direct and
countercyclical payments to agricultural producers for
certain commodities (cotton, feed grains, oilseeds, peanuts,
wheat, and rice) are expected to cost $51 billion
over the next 10 years. Beginning with the 2012 crop
(harvested in fiscal year 2013), those payments will be
calculated, in part, on 85 percent of a producer's base
acreage, which in general is determined by the average
number of acres planted with each eligible crop between
1998 and 2001.</p>

<p>This option would reduce the portion of a producer's
base acreage eligible for direct or countercyclical payments
by 20 percentage points. The option would reduce
spending for farm programs by $4 billion over the 2012-
2016 period and by about $10 billion over the 2012-
2021 period, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.</p>

<p>The primary advantage of reducing the portion of a producer's
base acreage that is eligible for payments is that
the reduction would affect all participants in the program
in proportion to their expected payments instead of disproportionately
affecting the producers of any particular
commodity.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of this option is that producers would
receive less income from the government. Another is that
other USDA payments, such as marketing loan benefits,
essentially guarantee minimum prices for certain crops
and therefore tend to send more market-distorting signals
to producers than direct and countercyclical payments
do. Consequently, some would argue that changing other
USDA payments would be a better approach because it
could generate greater reductions in market distortions.</p>
