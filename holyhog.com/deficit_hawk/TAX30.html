<div><a name="TAX30"></a><h1>Accelerate and Modify the Excise Tax on High-Cost Health Care Coverage</h1>

<p>
Although employer-paid premiums for health insurance
are part of many employees' total compensation, those
premiums are generally exempt from individual income
taxes and payroll taxes. Employees at firms offering
"cafeteria plans"--plans that allow employees to choose
between taxable cash wages and nontaxable fringe
benefits--can pay their share of premiums for employment-
based health insurance with pretax earnings. In
addition, contributions to certain other types of
employee accounts, which can be used to pay for many
health care costs not covered by insurance, may be
exempt from income and payroll taxes. Those include
employers' contributions to health reimbursement
accounts (HRAs), employees' contributions to flexible
spending accounts (FSAs), and employers' and employees'
contributions to health savings accounts (HSAs).</p>

<p>Starting in 2018, an excise tax will be imposed on
employment-based health care coverage if the total value
of that coverage--including employers' and employees'
contributions for health insurance and contributions
made through HRAs, FSAs, or HSAs for other health
care costs--exceeds a certain threshold. The tax will be
equal to 40 percent of the difference between that total
value and the threshold. In 2018, the annual threshold
will be $27,500 for family coverage and $10,200 for individual
coverage (which could be adjusted upward to
reflect faster-than-expected growth in health care costs
between 2010 and 2018). In 2019, the thresholds will
change in accordance with the rate of growth in the consumer
price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) plus
1 percentage point. In 2020 and subsequent years, the
thresholds will be indexed solely on the basis of the
CPI-U. Higher thresholds will apply to retirees between
the ages of 55 and 64 and to workers engaged in certain
high-risk professions. Employees participating in union-
sponsored plans will be subject only to the family thresholds.
Finally, in determining the amount of the tax,
employers will be allowed to adjust the cost of health
insurance coverage if the distribution of their workforce
by age and gender differs from that of a national risk
pool.</p>

<p>Under this option, implementation of the excise tax
would be accelerated and the thresholds would be lowered.
In 2014, the 40 percent excise tax would apply to
qualifying contributions that together exceeded $21,000
a year for family coverage and $8,200 for individual
coverage. Beginning in 2015, the thresholds--which are
based on the 80th percentile for health insurance premiums
paid by or through employers--would be indexed
for inflation using the CPI-U. Similar to the provisions of
current law, the thresholds would be 10 percent higher
for retirees ages 55 to 64 and for workers in designated
high-risk professions; however, the other adjustments
provided under current law would be eliminated. The
option would increase revenues from income and payroll
taxes by a total of $100 billion over the 2012-2016
period and by $310 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>As is the case under current law, the modified excise tax
would increase revenues in two ways. First, for employment-
based plans that remained above the thresholds, it
would generate additional excise tax revenues. Second,
many individuals and employers would probably respond
to the presence of the excise tax by shifting to lower-cost
insurance plans--plans with premiums below the tax
threshold--to avoid paying the excise tax. As a result,
total payments of health insurance premiums for those
individuals would be less than they would have been in
the absence of the tax. Because total compensation paid
by employers would not be affected over the long term,
lower expenditures for health insurance would mean
higher taxable wages for employees and, consequently,
higher revenues from income and payroll taxes.1</p>

<p>An argument in support of this option is that it could
dampen health care spending and thus restrain the
growth of health care costs. Many analysts maintain that
the tax preference for employment-based health insurance
distorts the markets for health insurance and health
care. That tax preference provides incentives for health
insurance plans to cover routine expenses as well as large,
unexpected costs because routine charges are subsidized
(through the tax exclusion) only if they are paid for
through an insurance plan (or other type of tax-favored
health plan, such as an FSA). Under this option, more
employees and their employers would have an incentive
to buy less-expensive health insurance and to reduce contributions
to FSAs and other tax-favored plans for health
care spending--which could reduce upward pressure on
costs for health care and encourage greater use of cost-
effective types of care. Those incentives would also grow
under current law but would be greater under this option
because the tax would start sooner and would apply to
a larger share of employment-based plans. Another
argument for this option is that it would simplify the
computation of the excise tax by eliminating adjustments
for the age and gender of a firm's workforce.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that it would probably
increase the financial burden on people with substantial
health problems. Employers might seek to avoid the tax
by shifting to plans that have lower premiums and higher
cost-sharing requirements, which would increase out-ofpocket
costs for those workers, and the dependents of
those workers, who use more services. In some cases,
those higher cost-sharing requirements might lead enrollees
to forgo care that would be beneficial to their health.
Another argument against this option is that more firms
would be subject to the tax simply because they had less-
healthy workers or because they operated in an area with
above-average costs for health care. In addition, by eliminating
the adjustment for age, the option would make
some firms liable for the tax if they had an older-thanaverage
workforce.</p>
