<div><a name="SPENDD18"></a><h1>Increase Fees for Use of the Inland Waterway System</h1>

<p>The Army Corps of Engineers spent about $900 million
in 2010 on the nation's system of inland waterways.
About 30 percent of those expenditures were devoted to
the construction of new navigation channels, locks, and
other infrastructure, and about 70 percent paid for the
operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure.
Current law allows up to half of the Corps' new construction
on inland waterways to be funded with revenues
from a tax on fuel consumed by towboats (which use
most segments of the system); the remaining costs of construction
and expenditures for operation and maintenance
are financed through appropriations not tied to the
revenue source.</p>

<p>This option would set fees high enough to cover all the
costs of constructing, operating, and maintaining inland
waterways. Those fees could take the form of higher fuel
taxes, charges for the use of locks, or assessments based on
the weight of transported goods and the distance those
goods travel. If implemented, the option would boost
collections (and thus reduce net spending) by $2 billion
over five years and by $4 billion through 2021.</p>

<p>The principal rationale for this option is that it would
increase economic efficiency. Imposing fees on the basis
of the actual cost associated with keeping the inland
waterway system open would encourage firms that
arrange for goods to be shipped--producers or logistics
specialists--to choose the most efficient routes and
modes of transportation (which in some cases might
involve transport by rail or highway or by another water
route). In addition, more efficient use of existing waterways
could alleviate congestion and perhaps curtail the
demand for new construction. Any congestion that
remained when fees covered costs would serve as a useful
signal of market demand, giving the Corps better information
about which additional construction projects
would be likely to provide the greatest net benefits.</p>

<p>The effects of such fees on efficiency would depend
largely on whether they were set at the same rate for all
segments of a waterway or were based on each segment's
operating costs. Because costs vary substantially from one
segment to another, systemwide fees would offer weaker
incentives for the efficient use of resources.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that higher fees might
slow economic development in some regions that depend
on waterway commerce. Although the increase could be
phased in to ameliorate those effects, doing so would
reduce revenues in the near term. Imposing higher fees
also would reduce the income of barge operators and
shippers in some areas, although those losses would be
small in the context of overall regional economies.</p>
