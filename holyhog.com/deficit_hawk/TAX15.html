<div><a name="TAX15"></a><h1>Eliminate Certain Tax Preferences for Education Expenses</h1>

<p>Federal support for higher education takes many forms,
including grants, subsidized loans, and tax preferences.
Since the enactment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997,
however, assistance provided through the tax system has
increased and expanded to families higher up the income
distribution.</p>

<p>In addition to several tax-advantaged accounts that allow
families to save for their child's postsecondary education,
taxpayers can also benefit from several education-related
credits and deductions. One of those allows taxpayers to
deduct up to $4,000 from their taxable income for qualifying
tuition and fees, whether they itemize deductions or
not. That deduction, which expired at the end of 2009,
was reinstated by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance
Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010
(Public Law 111-312). It is currently scheduled to expire
at the end of 2011. Another tax preference, the American
Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), covers up to $2,500 in
educational expenses (100 percent of the first $2,000 and
then 25 percent of the next $2,000) and is available for
up to four years of postsecondary education. Up to
40 percent of the credit (or $1,000) is refundable for
lower-income families. That credit is scheduled to expire
at the end of 2012.</p>

<p>Three other tax preferences will be in effect through the
end of the 10-year projection period under current law:</p>

<ul>
<li>
The Hope tax credit was replaced by the American
Opportunity Tax Credit in 2009 but will be reinstated
in 2013 when the AOTC is scheduled to expire. In
2008, the last year it was available, the Hope credit
was equal to 100 percent of the first $1,200 of qualifying
tuition and fees and 50 percent of the next $1,200
for a maximum credit of $1,800 per year. As was the
case before the Hope credit expired, the parameters
used to calculate the credit amount will be indexed for
inflation when the credit is reinstated. On the basis
of that adjustment, the Congressional Budget Office
estimates that the maximum credit in 2013 will be
$1,950. The Hope credit is nonrefundable (that is, the
credit amount may not exceed the filer's income tax
liability). It can be claimed only for expenses incurred
in the first two years of a postsecondary degree or certificate
program, and the student must be enrolled at
least half-time during that period. In 2008, the Hope
tax credit began to phase out for joint filers when their
modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeded
$96,000 and for single filers when their MAGI
exceeded $48,000.1 As with the parameters used to
calculate the credit amount, the income thresholds
for the Hope tax credit are also adjusted for inflation.
CBO estimates those thresholds will be $104,000 for
joint filers and $52,000 for single filers when the
Hope tax credit is reinstated in 2013.</li>
<li>
The nonrefundable Lifetime Learning tax credit provides
up to $2,000 for qualifying tuition and fees.
(The credit equals 20 percent of each dollar of qualifying
expenses up to a maximum of $10,000.) Only one
Lifetime Learning credit may be claimed per tax
return per year, but the expenses of more than one
family member (a taxpayer, spouse, or dependent)
may be included in the calculation. In 2011, the
Lifetime Learning tax credit begins to phase out for
joint filers whose MAGI is more than $102,000 and
for single filers whose MAGI exceeds $51,000. As
with the Hope tax credit, those income thresholds
are also adjusted for inflation. Unlike the Hope credit,
the Lifetime Learning credit can be used after the
first two years of postsecondary education and by
students who attend school less than half-time.
Taxpayers may not, however, claim both credits for the
same student in the same year.</li>
<li>
A tax deduction of up to $2,500 per year for interest
payments on student loans may be taken by itemizers
and nonitemizers alike. In 2011, the interest deduction
for student loans begins to phase out for joint filers
with MAGI above $120,000 and for single filers
with MAGI above $60,000. Although the maximum
deduction is not indexed for inflation, the income
thresholds for the phaseout ranges are adjusted for
inflation.</li>
</ul>

<p>This option would eliminate the Hope tax credit and the
Lifetime Learning tax credit beginning in 2013. The
option would also gradually eliminate the deductibility
of interest expenses for student loans. Because students
borrowed money with the expectation that a portion of
the interest would be deductible over the life of the loan,
the interest deduction for student loans would be phased
out in annual increments of $250 over a 10-year period.
If implemented, this option would raise revenues by
$20 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by $48 billion
over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of the option is that the current tax
benefits are not targeted to those who need assistance the
most. Many low-income families do not have sufficient
income tax liability to claim all--or in some cases, any--
of the education-related tax benefits. However, the cost of
higher education may impose a greater burden on those
families as a proportion of their income. Further, some
research indicates that lower-income individuals and families
may be more sensitive to the cost of higher education
than those with higher income and thus more likely to
enroll in higher education programs if tuition and fees are
subsidized.</p>

<p>A second rationale in favor of the option concerns the
administration of education benefits through the income
tax system. Education benefits administered through the
tax system are poorly timed because families must pay
tuition and fees before they can claim the benefits on
their tax returns. In contrast, federal spending programs
such as the Pell Grant program are designed to provide
assistance when the money is needed--at the time of
enrollment. Further, providing education assistance
through various credits and deductions, each with slightly
different eligibility rules and benefit amounts, makes it
difficult for families to determine which tax preferences
provide the most assistance. As a result, some families
may not choose the most advantageous educational benefits
for their particular economic circumstances.</p>

<p>A drawback of this policy option is that some households
would not receive as much assistance for educational
expenses unless federal outlays for education assistance
were expanded. The option would increase the financial
burden on families with postsecondary students--
particularly middle-income families who do not qualify
for current federal spending programs. Another drawback
is that despite the current system's complexity--which
creates overlapping tax benefits--some families may find
it easier to claim benefits on their tax returns (on which
they already provide information about their family
structure and income) than to fill out additional forms
for assistance through other federal programs.</p>
