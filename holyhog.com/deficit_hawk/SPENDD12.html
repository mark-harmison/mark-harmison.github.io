<div><a name="SPENDD12"></a><h1>Terminate the Medium Extended Air Defense System Program</h1>

<p>The Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) is
an air and missile defense system under joint development
by the United States, Germany, and Italy. It is
intended to provide low-and medium-altitude defense
against attack by short-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and other airborne weapons.
The program includes two types of radar, as well as
command-and-control systems, missile launchers, and an
interceptor missile. MEADS is slated to replace and
improve on the capabilities of the Patriot system, which is
approaching the end of scheduled production of its interceptor
missiles. As a result of delays in the development
of the MEADS interceptor, production of the Patriot
Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) interceptor was extended
into 2011, two years beyond its planned end date.</p>

<p>This option would terminate MEADS development.
In place of the new system, the option would continue
production of Patriot interceptors and initiate an engineering
effort to maintain and improve the Patriot
system. To estimate the savings from canceling MEADS,
the Congressional Budget Office has relied on plans
described in the December 2009 Selected Acquisition
Report for MEADS, which calls for procurement of
about 1,000 interceptors and 16 complete fire units over
the next 10 years. CBO estimates that canceling MEADS
would save about $4 billion in outlays over the next five
years and $13 billion over a decade. The 10-year savings
would come from discontinuing research and development
for the MEADS system (about $3 billion) and ending
the procurement of MEADS equipment (almost
$11 billion). In this option, the 5- and 10-year savings
would be partially offset by continuing to improve and
procure Patriot systems, including ground equipment;
CBO has assumed that nearly $400 million per year
would be spent on that effort, sufficient to procure
40 interceptors per year and provide $100 million per
year for engineering support and upgrades. CBO
estimates that the net savings for this option would be
about $3 billion over the next five years and nearly
$10 billion over a decade. In a February 2011 fact sheet,
the Department of Defense (DoD) indicated that it may
end participation in MEADS development after 2013
and not procure any operational MEADS systems; under
those circumstances, CBO's estimates of savings would
change. CBO's estimates do not include any costs associated
with canceling the contract.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that the program
has experienced technical difficulties, and development of
the MEADS interceptor has exceeded DoD's thresholds
for both cost growth and schedule delay. In addition,
some critics of the program argue that MEADS may not
provide effective protection. Defense Daily, for example,
on August 27, 2010, cited an internal Army memo that
advocates "harvesting MEADS technologies and improving
the Patriot program it was designed to replace," on
the basis of concerns that MEADS technical requirements
do not address current and emerging threats.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that the capability
improvements intended for MEADS may be valuable for
addressing the ballistic and cruise missile threats that U.S.
forces may face in the future. In its 2009 report, Ballistic
and Cruise Missile Threat, DoD's National Air and Space
Intelligence Center concluded that "ballistic and cruise
missiles present a significant threat to U.S. and Allied
forces" that "continues to increase with the proliferation
of missile technology." Also, because MEADS involves
international collaboration, canceling the program would
require negotiations with the program partners, which
might prove diplomatically sensitive.</p>
