<div><a name="SPENDM12"></a><h1>Add a "Public Plan" to the Health Insurance Exchanges</h1>

<p>Starting in 2014, health insurance exchanges will be
established through which individuals and families may
purchase private coverage. In general, people who are not
offered coverage through their employer and purchase
coverage through an exchange will be eligible for federal
subsidies on a sliding scale if their income is between
138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
The amount of the subsidies will be based in part on the
premium of the second cheapest plan offered through the
exchange in an enrollee's area of residence. Small employers
will have the option to allow their workers to buy coverage
through the exchanges, and beginning in 2017,
states may grant large employers that choice as well. In
those cases, the affected workers will not receive exchange
subsidies, but the costs of their coverage will be excluded
from income and payroll taxation, just as the costs of
other employment-based health coverage are currently
excluded.</p>

<p>Under this option, the Secretary of Health and Human
Services would establish and administer a public health
insurance plan that would be offered alongside private
plans through the exchanges beginning in 2014. The
public plan would have to charge premiums that fully
covered its costs for benefit payments and administrative
expenses. The plan's payment rates for physicians and
other practitioners would be set to exceed Medicare's
rates in 2010 by 5 percent and would rise annually
through 2014 and beyond to reflect estimated increases
in physicians' costs; those payment rates would not be
subject to the future reductions required by Medicare's
sustainable growth rate formula. The public plan would
pay hospitals and other providers the same amounts that
would be paid under Medicare, on average, and would
establish payment rates for prescription drugs through
negotiation. Health care providers would not be required
to participate in the public plan in order to participate in
Medicare.</p>

<p>In the Congressional Budget Office's estimation, the public
plan's premiums would be 5 percent to 7 percent
lower, on average, than the premiums of private plans
offered in the health insurance exchanges. The differences
between the premiums of the public plan and the average
premiums of private plans would vary across the country,
largely because of geographic differences in the plans' relative
payment rates for providers. Those differences in
average premiums would also reflect differences in the
other factors that affect all health insurance premiums,
including administrative costs, the degree of benefit management
applied to control spending, and the characteristics
of the enrollees (the effects of which would be partly
offset by the risk-adjustment mechanism that will be used
in the exchanges).</p>

<p>This option, CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee
on Taxation estimate, would reduce federal budget deficits
by about $88 billion over the 2012-2021 period.
That reduction is the combination of an almost $27 billion
reduction in outlays (mostly from a reduction in
exchange subsidies) and a $61 billion increase in tax revenues
(mostly from changes in employment-based insurance
coverage). Those estimates include effects on other
outlays and revenues related to insurance coverage (such
as Medicaid outlays and penalties on employers and
uninsured individuals).</p>

<p>Overall, exchange subsidies would be reduced by $35 billion
over the 2014-2021 period. (Although the exchange
subsidies for premiums are structured as refundable tax
credits, most of the resulting costs are classified as outlays
because the payments will usually exceed their recipients'
total income tax liability.) That decline in subsidies is the
net effect of several influences. By CBO's estimates, the
public plan's premium in many parts of the country
would be lower than the second-lowest premium among
private plans; the introduction of the public plan in those
places would therefore reduce federal subsidies that are
tied to that benchmark. The existence of a public plan
with substantial enrollment would also, CBO expects,
place additional competitive pressure on private plans
operating in the exchanges to lower their premiums to
some degree, thereby producing a further reduction in
federal subsidies. Partly offsetting those two sources of
federal savings would be higher enrollment in exchange
plans, which would increase subsidy payments.</p>

<p>The increase in tax revenues under this option results primarily
from changes in employment-based coverage,
which is offset in part by an increase in costs for providing
tax credits to small employers. Two developments
would result in a greater share of employees' compensation
taking the form of taxable wages and salaries (rather
than nontaxable health benefits), thereby resulting in
higher revenues. First, because the public plan would
make the exchanges more attractive to individual purchasers,
some employers would forgo offering coverage
altogether, thus reducing their spending on employment-
based health insurance and increasing the share of compensation
devoted to taxable wages and salaries. Second,
the availability of a relatively inexpensive public plan
would also lead some employers to purchase lower-cost
coverage for their employees through the exchanges. The
resulting reduction in spending on employment-based
coverage would further increase the share of total compensation
devoted to taxable wages and salaries. Those
budgetary effects would be partly offset by the reduction
in revenues that would occur as more small employers
took advantage of the tax credits that will be available
when purchasing coverage through the exchanges.</p>

<p>Enrollment in the public plan would be affected by several
considerations, including its relative premium and
the number and types of providers that decided to participate
in it. On the basis of all relevant factors, CBO estimated
that, on average, about 13 million people--about
one-third of the estimated 38 million that would obtain
coverage through the insurance exchanges--would enroll
in the public plan in the 2017-2021 period. Of that
number, on average, about 25 million people would purchase
coverage individually, and about 13 million people
would obtain employment-based coverage through the
exchanges. (Given all of the factors at work, however,
those estimates are subject to an unusually high degree of
uncertainty.)</p>

<p>Compared with projections of health insurance coverage
under current law for the 2017-2021 period, under this
option, about one and a half million more people would
obtain individually purchased coverage, CBO estimates,
and about one and a half million fewer would have
employment-based coverage. The option would have
minimal effects on the number of people with other
sources of coverage and the number of people who would
be uninsured.</p>

<p>Supporters of this option might point to the federal savings
that would result. In addition, because the public
plan would be one of the lowest-cost plans in many areas,
the option would help reduce premiums for some individuals,
families, and employers who purchase insurance
through the exchanges but do not receive exchange subsidies.
Another argument for this option is that a public
plan would increase the competitive pressure on private
plans, leading them to reduce their premiums.</p>

<p>Opponents might be concerned that the public plan's
payment rates would be substantially lower than rates for
private plans in many parts of the country, which could
lead some providers who participated in the public plan
to reduce the quality of care they furnished. Although
providers' participation in the public plan would be voluntary,
opponents might anticipate that enrollment in
the plan could be sufficiently large that providers would
face substantial pressure to participate.</p>

<p>Another concern is that the federal government would
have to finance the public plan's losses if the plan
attracted high-cost enrollees and was unable to collect
enough in premiums to cover its costs. (The public plan
would be required to build up a contingency fund.) More
generally, opponents might object to a greater federal role
in providing health insurance.</p>
