<div><a name="TAX6"></a><h1>Curtail the Deduction for Charitable Giving</h1>

<p>Current law allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct the
value of their contributions to qualifying charitable
organizations. By lowering the after-tax cost of donating
to charities, the deduction provides an added incentive
to donate. In 2008 (the most recent year for which data
are available), taxpayers claimed $173 billion in charitable
contributions on 39 million tax returns.</p>

<p>The deduction is restricted in two ways. First, charitable
contributions may not exceed 50 percent of a taxpayer's
adjusted gross income (AGI) in any one year. Second,
beginning in 2013, with the expiration of the Tax Relief,
Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job
Creation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-312), the total
value of certain itemized deductions--including the
deduction for charitable donations--will be reduced if
the taxpayer's AGI is above a specified threshold.</p>

<p>This option would further curtail the deduction for charitable
donations while preserving a tax incentive for
donating. Only contributions in excess of 2 percent of
AGI would be deductible for a taxpayer who itemizes.
That amount would still be subject to the additional
reduction described above for higher-income taxpayers in
2013 and later. Limiting the deduction to contributions
in excess of 2 percent of AGI would match the treatment
that now applies to unreimbursed employee expenses,
such as job-related travel costs and union dues. Such a
policy change would increase revenues by $86 billion
from 2012 through 2016 and by $219 billion from
2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that, even without
a deduction, a significant share of charitable donations
would probably still be made. Therefore, allowing taxpayers
to deduct contributions is economically inefficient
because it results in a large loss of federal revenue for a
very small increase in charitable giving. For taxpayers who
contribute more than 2 percent of their AGI to charity,
this option would maintain the current incentive to
donate but at much less cost to the federal government.
People who make large donations often are more responsive
to that tax incentive than people who make small
contributions. Moreover, smaller contributions are apt to
be a source of abuse among taxpayers because donations
that are under $250 do not require the same degree of
documentation as those that are larger.</p>

<p>A potential disadvantage of this option is that total charitable
giving would decline, albeit by only a small amount.
People who contribute less than 2 percent of their AGI
would no longer have a tax incentive to donate, and
many of them could reduce their contributions.
Although larger donors would still have an incentive to
give, they would have slightly lower after-tax income
because of the smaller deduction and thus might reduce
their contributions as well (although by a lesser percentage
than smaller donors). Another effect of creating the
2 percent floor is that it would encourage taxpayers
who had planned to make gifts over several years to combine
donations into a single tax year to qualify for the
deduction.</p>
