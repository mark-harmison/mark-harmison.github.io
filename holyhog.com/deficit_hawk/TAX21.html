<div><a name="TAX21"></a><h1>End the Expensing of Exploration and Development Costs for Extractive Industries</h1>

<p>Current tax law treats the extractive industries that produce
oil, natural gas, and minerals more favorably than it
does most other industries. One incentive designed to
encourage exploration for and development of oil, gas,
and hard minerals allows producers to "expense" rather
than capitalize some of their costs. Expensing allows companies
to fully deduct the costs of exploration and development
from taxable income as they are incurred rather
than waiting to deduct those costs over time as the
income they produce is generated.</p>

<p>Other industries, by contrast, must deduct costs more
slowly, according to prescribed rates of depreciation or
depletion. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 established uniform
capitalization rules that require certain direct and
indirect costs related to property either to be deducted
when the property is sold or to be depreciated over several
years. In either case, the businesses involved must postpone
the deduction of those costs from their taxable
income. Intangible costs (such as maintaining a working-
capital fund) that are related to drilling and development
and the costs for mine development and exploration are
exempt from those rules. The ability to expense such
costs gives extractive industries a tax advantage that other
industries do not have.</p>

<p>The costs that companies can expense include those
incurred for excavating mines, drilling wells, and prospecting
for hard minerals. The rules do not apply across
the board to producers of oil and natural gas, however.
Although current law allows independent oil and gas
producers and noncorporate mineral producers to fully
expense their costs, that practice is limited to 70 percent
of costs for "integrated" oil and gas producers (companies
with substantial retailing or refining activity) and for corporate
mineral producers. Those companies must deduct
the remaining 30 percent of their costs over 60 months.</p>

<p>This option would replace the expensing of exploration
and development costs for oil, gas, and minerals with the
standard capitalization rules set in the Tax Reform Act of
1986, increasing revenues by $8 billion from 2012
through 2016 and by a total of $10 billion over the
2012-2021 period. (Those amounts reflect the assumption
that businesses could still expense some of their
costs, including those associated with unproductive wells
and mines.)</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that expensing distorts
the allocation of society's resources in several ways.
First, it encourages the use of resources for drilling and
mining that might be employed more productively elsewhere
in the economy. Second, it could influence the way
resources are allocated within the extractive industries.
A company could decide what to produce not on the
basis of factors related to economic productivity but on
the basis of the size of the advantage that expensing provides
(for example, the difference between the immediate
deduction and the deduction over time, which reflects
the true useful life of the capital involved). Such decisions
also could rest on whether the producer must pay the
alternative minimum tax, under which expensing is
limited. Third, expensing encourages producers to extract
more resources in a shorter time. That, in the short run,
could make the United States less dependent on imported
oil; but, in the long run, it could deplete the nation's store
of oil for extraction and cause greater reliance on foreign
producers.</p>

<p>An argument against such a policy change is that exploration
and development costs should be expensed because
they are ordinary operating expenses. Supporters of
expensing also argue that the tax advantage is necessary to
encourage producers to continue exploring and developing
the strategic resources that are essential to the nation's
energy security.</p>
