<div><a name="SPENDD27"></a><h1>Eliminate Certain Grant Programs for Elementary and Secondary Education</h1>

<p>The Department of Education distributes funding for
more than 50 discretionary grant programs to state and
local educational agencies. Eleven of those programs
address the physical, emotional, and social well-being of
students both inside and outside the school environment.
Those grants are allocated to state and local educational
agencies on the basis of a formula or are competitively
awarded to local educational agencies and nonprofit entities.
Funding for those grant programs totaled $1.5 billion
in 2010. The largest grant program in this group is
the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program,
which accounted for $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion
in funding in 2010. That program awards grants to
states according to a formula based on the number of
poor students in the state. States then award competitive
grants to local educational agencies or community-based
organizations to establish or expand centers that offer
educational services and opportunities outside normal
classroom hours.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate those 11 grant programs.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that doing so
would reduce federal outlays by about $6 billion through
2016 and by $14 billion through 2021.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that an evaluation
of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program
found that those centers were not attaining their
stated goals. That evaluation, funded by the Department
of Education, concluded that programs funded by those
grants had no significant impact on the academic
achievement, parental involvement, or homework completion
of participating students relative to similar students
not participating in the program.1 More broadly,
some people argue that educating children is primarily a
responsibility of state and local governments, that the
federal government's involvement should be minimal,
and that grant programs such as the ones this option
would eliminate go beyond an appropriate role for the
federal government.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that federal funding is
necessary to augment state and local efforts to educate
children growing up in poor families; for those families,
federal resources help compensate for a lack of resources
in their home environment. Opponents of this option
may also point to research that has shown that increasing
the social, physical, and emotional health of students
helps them become higher achievers. Particularly relevant
to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program
is a body of research (compiled by the Harvard
Family Research Project) that found that children who
participate in well-implemented, high-quality after-
school programs make larger cognitive gains while they
are enrolled and exhibit better educational outcomes after
leaving the program than do children who receive no
such intervention.2</p>
