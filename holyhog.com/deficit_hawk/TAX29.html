<div><a name="TAX29"></a><h1>Increase All Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages to $16 per Proof Gallon</h1>

<p>
In 2009, the federal government collected $9.6 billion in
revenue from excise taxes on distilled spirits, beer, and
wine. The different alcoholic beverages are taxed at different
rates. Specifically, the alcohol content of beer and
wine is taxed at a much lower rate than the alcohol content
of distilled spirits because the taxes are determined
on the basis of different liquid measures. Distilled spirits
are measured in proof gallons (a standard unit for measuring
the alcohol content of a liquid). The current excise
tax levied on those spirits, $13.50 per proof gallon, translates
to about 21 cents per ounce of alcohol. Beer, by contrast,
is measured by the barrel, and the current tax rate of
$18 per barrel translates to about 10 cents per ounce of
alcohol (under the assumption that the average alcohol
content of beer is 4.5 percent). The current levy on wine
is $1.07 per gallon, or about 8 cents per ounce of alcohol
(assuming an average alcohol content of 11 percent).</p>

<p>This option would standardize the base on which the federal
excise tax is levied by using the proof gallon as the
measure for all alcoholic beverages. The tax would be
raised to $16 per proof gallon, thus increasing revenues
by about $29 billion over the 2012-2016 period and by
$60 billion over the 2012-2021 period. (Because excise
taxes reduce producers' and consumers' income, higher
excise taxes would lead to reductions in revenues from
income and payroll taxes. The estimates shown here
reflect those reductions.)</p>

<p>A tax of $16 per proof gallon would equal about 25 cents
per ounce of alcohol. Under this option, the federal excise
tax on a 750-milliliter bottle (commonly referred to as a
fifth) of distilled spirits would rise from about $2.14 to
$2.54. The tax on a six-pack of beer would jump from
about 33 cents to 81 cents, and the tax on a 750-milliliter
bottle of wine would increase by a similar amount, from
about 21 cents to 70 cents.</p>

<p>Experts agree that the consumption of alcohol creates
costs for society that are not reflected in the pretax price
of alcoholic beverages. Examples of those "external costs"
include spending on health care that is related to alcohol
consumption and covered by the public, losses in productivity
stemming from alcohol consumption that are borne
by others besides the consumer, and the loss of lives and
property that results from alcohol-related accidents and
crime. Calculating such costs is difficult. However, a
study conducted for the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism estimated that the external economic
costs of alcohol abuse exceeded $100 billion in
1998--an amount far greater than the revenues currently
derived from taxes on alcoholic beverages.1 When
adjusted for inflation, current excise tax rates on alcohol
are far lower than historical levels. In the 1950s, excise
taxes accounted for nearly half of the pretax price of
alcohol; they now account for between 10 percent and
20 percent of the pretax price.</p>

<p>One argument in favor of raising excise taxes on alcoholic
beverages is that they would reduce alcohol use--and
thus the external costs of that use--and make consumers
of alcoholic beverages pay a larger share of such costs.
Research has consistently shown that higher prices lead to
less alcohol consumption, even among heavy drinkers.</p>

<p>Moreover, raising excise taxes to reduce consumption
might be desirable, regardless of the effect on external
costs, if lawmakers believed that consumers underestimated
the harm they do to themselves by drinking.
Heavy drinking is known to cause organ damage and
cognitive impairment; and the links between highway
accidents and drinking, which are especially strong
among the young, are well-documented. Substantial evidence
also indicates that the use of alcohol from an early
age can lead to heavy consumption later in life. When
deciding how much to drink, people--particularly young
people--may not adequately consider such long-term
risks to their health.</p>

<p>An increase in taxes on alcoholic beverages would have
disadvantages as well. It would make a tax that is already
regressive--one that takes up a greater percentage of
income for low-income families than for middle- and
upper-income families--even more so. In addition, it
would affect not only problem drinkers but also drinkers
who imposed no costs on society and who thus would be
unduly penalized. Furthermore, higher taxes would
reduce consumption by some moderate drinkers whose
intake of alcohol is believed to have health benefits.
(Moderate alcohol consumption, particularly of wine, has
been linked to lower incidence of heart disease, obesity,
and stroke and to increases in life expectancy in middle
age.) Finally, with regard to the argument that some
drinkers underestimate the personal costs of alcohol
consumption, some opponents of raising taxes on alcohol
argue that the government should not try to modify
consumers' private behavior.</p>
