<div><a name="SPENDD19"></a><h1>Eliminate the International Trade Administration's Trade Promotion Activities or Charge the Beneficiaries</h1>

<p>The Manufacturing and Services unit of the International
Trade Administration (ITA) in the Department of Commerce
strives to enhance the competitiveness of U.S.
industries and to increase exports. ITA also operates the
U.S. Commercial Service, which is the trade promotion
arm of the agency. The service counsels domestic businesses
on issues related to exports and engages in trade
advocacy for U.S. companies. It charges fees for those services,
but the fees do not cover the costs of all activities.
This option encompasses two alternatives: eliminating
ITA's trade promotion activities or charging the beneficiaries
for those services. Either change would save about
$2 billion through 2016 and almost $4 billion over the
2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>The principal rationale for eliminating ITA's trade promotion
activities is that such business activities are usually
better left to the companies and industries that are
likely to benefit rather than to a government agency. In
addition, having the government engage in such activities
(without charging the beneficiaries for their full cost) is
an expensive means of helping U.S. businesses because
the benefits are partially passed on to consumers and
firms abroad in the form of lower prices for U.S. exports.
Hence, the cost to taxpayers is likely to be larger than the
benefit to U.S. businesses. Furthermore, in its 2008 evaluation
using the Program Assessment Rating Tool, the
Office of Management and Budget concluded that
businesses can obtain services similar to those offered by
ITA from state, local, and private-sector entities.</p>

<p>An argument against eliminating ITA's trade promotion
activities is that they may be subject to some economies
of scale, so having one entity (the federal government)
counsel exporters about foreign legal and other requirements,
disseminate information about foreign markets,
and promote U.S. products abroad might make sense.</p>

<p>An alternative way to reduce net federal spending but
continue ITA's activities would be to charge the beneficiaries
for their full costs. Fully funding ITA's trade promotion
activities through voluntary charges, however, could
prove difficult. In many cases, it would be impossible to
promote the products of selected businesses that were
willing to pay for such promotion without also promoting
the products of other companies in the same industry.
In those circumstances, there would be little incentive for
companies to purchase ITA's services because they would
probably accrue benefits regardless of whether they paid
for them. Consequently, if the federal government
wanted to charge beneficiaries for ITA's services, it might
have to require that all companies in an industry (or the
industry's national trade group) decide collectively
whether to buy the services. If an industry chose to purchase
the services, all of the companies in the industry
would be required to pay according to some equitable
formula.</p>
