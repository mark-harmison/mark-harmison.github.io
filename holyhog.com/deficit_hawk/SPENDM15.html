<div><a name="SPENDM15"></a><h1>Convert the Federal Share of Medicaid's Payments for Long-Term Care Services into a Block Grant</h1>

<p>The Medicaid program funds coverage for two different
types of health care: acute care (including inpatient hospital
stays, visits to physicians' offices, and prescription
drugs) and long-term care (services such as nursing home
care and home- and community-based services). The program
is financed jointly by the states and the federal government,
with the federal government's share equal to a
percentage determined by a formula defined in law. The
formula assigns a higher federal reimbursement rate to
states that have lower income per capita (and vice versa).
Currently, that share--referred to as the federal medical
assistance percentage (FMAP)--is approximately 57 percent,
on average across the states.</p>

<p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal
share of Medicaid outlays in 2011 to be $155 billion for
acute care and $71 billion for long-term care, excluding
the enhanced federal matching funds established in the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(ARRA, Public Law 111-5) and extended under subsequent
legislation.</p>

<p>This option would convert the federal share of Medicaid
payments for long-term care services, as well as a portion
of the federal share of Medicaid administrative costs, into
a block grant to each state, as previous legislation did
with funding for welfare programs. Starting in 2012, a
state's block grant for each fiscal year would apply to
long-term care services for all of its Medicaid beneficiaries,
but acute care would continue to receive funding as
it does under current law. This option includes two alternatives
for structuring the block grants, differentiated by
how they would adjust the amount of the block grant
annually. Specifically, a state's block grant would equal its
2010 federal Medicaid payment for long-term care services
(excluding the enhanced matching provided in
ARRA) indexed annually to one of the following factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>
The employment cost index. Indexing each state's
block grant to annual increases in the employment
cost index (ECI)--which reflects changes in labor
costs such as benefits, wages, and salaries--would
reduce federal outlays by $73 billion from 2012 to
2016 and by $287 billion from 2012 to 2021. That
would represent a 25 percent reduction in estimated
federal spending on long-term care over the 2012-
2021 period relative to current law. This alternative
would generate savings because federal payments for
Medicaid are projected under current law to grow
faster than the cost of labor as a result of both rising
costs per beneficiary and an increasing number of
beneficiaries.
</li>
<li>
The ECI and changes in the number of aged, blind,
and disabled people enrolled in Medicaid. If block
grants were indexed to the ECI and also to changes in
the size of the Medicaid aged, blind, and disabled populations,
savings would be somewhat lower than those
generated by the first alternative because the Medicaid
aged, blind, and disabled populations are expected to
increase over the next 10 years. Under this approach,
savings would total $41 billion for the 2012-2016
period and $187 billion for the 2012-2021 period.
That would represent a 16 percent reduction in estimated
long-term care spending by the federal government
during that decade relative to current law.
</li>
</ul>

<p>CBO's estimates represent weighted averages of possible
savings because changes in these index factors and
changes in federal spending on long-term care under current
law are both uncertain. If the adjustment was based
on the ECI alone, states that had faster growth in their
aged, blind, and disabled populations would need to
make larger reductions in the long-term care benefits they
provide to each Medicaid beneficiary or undertake larger
increases in their own spending to compensate for the gap
in federal funding. At the same time, states with slower
growth in their aged, blind, and disabled populations
would be in a better position to manage the long-term
care benefits they provide or reduce the amount of money
they allocate to long-term care services. If the adjustment
also took into consideration changes in the size of states'
populations of aged, blind, and disabled Medicaid enrollees,
then states' financial circumstances would not be
affected by the growth of those groups. That alternative
would not produce as high a level of savings, however.</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that a block grant would
provide greater predictability in federal spending for
long-term care services, which represents a large portion
of total Medicaid spending. Furthermore, it would eliminate
the federal subsidy for each additional dollar that
states spend on long-term care services, thereby providing
a greater incentive for states to find more cost-effective
ways to care for individuals who need long-term care.
Another rationale is that, if the block grant policy was
coupled with reductions in federal program requirements,
states would have greater flexibility to design and administer
long-term care benefits in ways that might better
serve their populations. With greater freedom to tailor
their own programs, states could modify program eligibility
and the benefits provided, including the types and settings
of services offered. An additional rationale for this
option is that converting the federal contribution to a
block grant would reduce states' ability to obtain more
federal assistance than intended under the law. For example,
in the past, some states have inflated Medicaid payments
to institutional facilities and then required those
facilities to pay special state taxes. That strategy boosted
states' federal matching funds without a corresponding
increase in their net costs for the program. Over the past
10 years, the Congress and the Department of Health
and Human Services have acted to rein in that practice.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that converting long-
term care payments into a block grant would shift some
of the burden of Medicaid's growing costs to the states.
Depending on the extent of flexibility provided in the
legislation that would create the block grant, states could
drop optional Medicaid services. Ending federal matching
payments for long-term care services would eliminate
the existing incentive for states to spend more on long-
term care, possibly reducing the options available to people
in need of those services. Another argument against
the option is that distinguishing between long-term care
and acute care could be difficult administratively, especially
in cases where individuals receive both types of care.
For example, hospital patients who receive acute care services
often require additional post-acute services after
they are released; those services may be provided in the
same venues in which long-term care services are delivered
and by the same providers. Thus, rules would need
to be established to define when long-term care services
would be covered by the block grant and when such services
would be covered by the acute care part of the Medicaid
program. A further argument against this option is
that greater discretion for the states in how they structure
their Medicaid programs creates the potential for
increased disparity from one state to another in eligibility
criteria and benefit packages.</p>
