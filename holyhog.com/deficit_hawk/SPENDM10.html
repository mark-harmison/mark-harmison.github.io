<div><a name="SPENDM10"></a><h1>Eliminate Subsidized Loans to Graduate Students</h1>

<p>The federal government operates programs to help students
and their parents pay for postsecondary education.
Subsidized Stafford loans help students with demonstrated
financial need pay for their education, and unsubsidized
Stafford loans are available, without regard to
need, to any student. (The labels "subsidized" and
"unsubsidized" refer to the terms of the loans, not to
whether the federal government incurs subsidy costs for
the program.) Borrowers of both subsidized and unsubsidized
loans benefit from interest rates that are not generally
available to those without a demonstrated credit history
or collateral and from deferment of repayment until
six months after a student leaves school. Students with
subsidized loans benefit further because the government
also forgives interest on those loans while the students
are enrolled and for six months after they leave school.
Also, most loan programs offer flexible repayment plans
that allow for extended repayment periods or that cap
required monthly payments at an amount intended to be
manageable, based on income and family size.</p>

<p>This option would end, in 2012, the practice of making
new subsidized loans to graduate students, on the presumption
that those students would generally take out
unsubsidized loans instead. The option would reduce
federal outlays by more than $8 billion from 2012 to
2016 and by about $18 billion from 2012 to 2021. (The
Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires that the fed
eral budget record all costs and collections associated with
a new loan in the year in which the loan is disbursed.)</p>

<p>An argument for this option is that graduate students
who lose access to subsidized loans would be able to take
out unsubsidized federal loans for the same amount and
still benefit from few or no requirements with respect to
credit history or collateral and from repayment options
that take into account borrowers' financial circumstances.
Another argument in favor of this option is that it would
help focus federal student aid on the area that some people
believe is the federal government's primary responsibility--
making a college education available to all high
school graduates. According to that rationale, graduate
students have already received the benefit of higher
education.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that graduate students
often amass large amounts of debt because of the number
of years of schooling required to complete advanced
degrees. Without the benefit of interest forgiveness while
they are enrolled in school, that debt would be substantially
larger when they entered the repayment period
because the cumulative interest on the money borrowed
over the years would be added to loan balances. Also,
opponents of this option might argue that federal support
for graduate students is no less important than support
for undergraduates because graduate students are most
likely to effect scientific, technological, and other
advances that will benefit the nation as a whole.</p>
