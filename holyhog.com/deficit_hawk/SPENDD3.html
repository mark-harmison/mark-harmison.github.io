<p>In the mid-1990s, the Department of Defense (DoD)
created the TRICARE program to reform its system for
providing health care for members of the military and
their dependents, as well as for eligible military retirees
and their families. About 15 percent of enlisted service
members and approximately 50 percent of officers
remain in the military for an entire career and therefore
qualify for health care benefits as retirees. Because most
military personnel enter the armed forces between the
ages of 18 and 22 and are able to retire after serving
20 years, they become eligible for retiree health care benefits
at a relatively young age (as early as age 38) and retain
some form of eligibility for the remainder of their lives.</p>

<p>TRICARE offers participants three different alternatives
for obtaining health care coverage: a plan that operates
like a health maintenance organization (HMO), called
TRICARE Prime; a plan that operates as a preferred-
provider network, called TRICARE Extra; and a traditional
fee-for-service plan, called TRICARE Standard.
Military retirees who are not yet eligible for Medicare
(generally those ages 38 to 64) may enroll in TRICARE
Prime by paying an annual enrollment fee of $230 (for
single coverage) or $460 (for family coverage). In addition,
those Prime enrollees make a $12 copayment for
each outpatient visit to a civilian physician or other civilian
health care provider. (Visits to military providers are
free.) Retirees who do not choose to enroll in TRICARE
Prime may receive benefits under TRICARE Extra or
Standard without paying an enrollment fee. Participants
in those plans must pay an annual deductible of $150
(for single coverage) or $300 (for family coverage) before
typical cost-sharing rates apply. TRICARE enrollment
fees, copayments, and deductibles have not changed since
1995.</p>

<p>Military retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime incur
smaller costs than they would owe under typical civilian
plans for which they might be eligible (through their
current employers, for example). DoD has estimated
that, in 2009, a typical military retiree and his or her
family who enrolled in the Prime plan incurred about
$860 in annual out-of-pocket costs (that is, TRICARE
copayments and the enrollment fee). By contrast, again
according to DoD's estimates, a similar retiree with family
coverage who enrolled in an HMO through a civilian
employment-based plan typically paid $5,200 in premiums
(not including the share paid by his or her employer)
and copayments. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries also use
the system more than do comparable civilian beneficiaries:
DoD estimates that Prime enrollees use services at
rates that are higher by 77 percent for inpatient services
and 55 percent for outpatient services than the rates for
civilian HMO enrollees.</p>

<p>This option would raise the enrollment fees, copayments,
and deductibles for younger military retirees--those
younger than 65--who wished to use TRICARE. Beneficiaries
with single coverage could enroll in TRICARE
Prime by paying a $550 annual fee, and those with family
coverage could enroll for $1,100 annually. The family
enrollment fee of $1,100 per year is approximately equivalent
to the $460 fee first instituted in 1995, after adjusting
for the nationwide growth in health care spending per
capita. Under this option, each medical visit to a Prime
provider in the civilian network would entail a copayment
of $30, which, again, is approximately equivalent to
the amount that was established in 1995. Copayments
for mental health visits and inpatient care would also be
adjusted accordingly. Single retirees (or their surviving
spouse) who used TRICARE Standard or Extra would
face an annual deductible of $350; the annual deductible
for families would be $700. Those increases would also
be consistent with the nationwide growth in per capita
health care spending. In addition--and for the first
time--users of TRICARE Standard or Extra would be
required to enroll and pay a $50 annual fee for single coverage
or a $100 annual fee for family coverage. All of
those new or increased fees, copayments, and deductibles
would be indexed in the future to reflect the nationwide
growth in per capita spending for health care.</p>

<p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if
TRICARE fees, copayments, and deductibles were modified
according to this option, discretionary outlays for
DoD's TRICARE program would be reduced, on net, by
about $28 billion over the 2012-2021 period, assuming
that appropriations would be reduced accordingly. But
the option could cause some eligible retirees to switch to
other federal programs, such as Medicaid (if the individual
has low income), the Federal Employees Health Benefits
(FEHB) program (if the person is employed as a civilian
by the federal government), or programs of the
Veterans Health Administration. This option would
increase mandatory spending for Medicaid and for FEHB
annuitants by about $440 million over the same period.
(Total additional costs would be greater, but some have
already been incorporated in the baseline. See the note to
the above table.) The estimates do not include the reduction
in individual income and payroll tax revenues that
might result from a shift of some labor compensation
from a taxable to a nontaxable form.</p>

<p>One rationale for this option is that TRICARE coverage
and space-available care at military treatment facilities
were originally considered a supplement or a safety net to
ensure the availability of health care for military retirees
and their dependents, not as a replacement for benefits
offered by postservice civilian employers. The migration
of retirees from civilian to TRICARE coverage is one
factor behind the rapid increase in TRICARE spending
since 1999, which may mean that fewer resources are
available for DoD to purchase and maintain weapon
systems and other equipment or for other defense
priorities. This option would begin to curtail the growth
in health care costs, freeing those resources for other
important uses.</p>

<p>An argument against changing access to TRICARE coverage
for military retirees and their dependents is that
those retirees made decisions about continuing their
period of active-duty service with the understanding that
they would receive medical care free or at a very low cost
after retiring from the military. Significant limitations on
TRICARE coverage for military retirees and their dependents
would impose a financial cost on many of those
beneficiaries and could adversely affect military retention.
Another potential disadvantage of this option is that the
health of users who remained in TRICARE might suffer
if they were discouraged from seeking health care or treating
their illnesses in a timely manner because of higher
copayments. However, their health might not be affected
significantly if the higher copayments fostered more disciplined
use of medical resources and only discouraged
the use of low-value health care.</p>
