<div><a name="SPENDM4"></a><h1>Prohibit New Enrollment in the Conservation Stewardship Program</h1>

<p>The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) gives agricultural
producers financial and technical help with conserving
and improving soil, water, air, energy, and plant
and animal life on agricultural lands. Under the CSP, producers
enter into five-year contracts (in some cases, those
contracts may be extended for an additional five years)
with the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to undertake
various conservation measures--such as enhancing
wildlife habitats or renovating windbreaks--in exchange
for annual payments. For every acre enrolled in the CSP,
a producer receives compensation for carrying out and
maintaining new conservation activities and for improving,
maintaining, and managing existing conservation
practices. Current law limits new enrollment in the CSP
to 12.769 million acres per year, at an average cost of
$18 per acre.</p>

<p>This option would prohibit new enrollments in the Conservation
Stewardship Program beginning in 2012. Land
currently enrolled in the CSP would be eligible to continue
to receive payments until the contract expired. By
the Congressional Budget Office's estimates, this change
would reduce spending by about $2 billion over 5 years
and by almost $11 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>One argument for phasing out the CSP is that some provisions
of the program limit its effectiveness. For example,
paying producers for conservation practices they have
already adopted does not enhance the nation's conservation
efforts. The criteria used by USDA to determine
whether improvements in existing conservation practices
have been made are not clear, and the absence of such
objective measurements could result in higher payments
than necessary to encourage adoption of new conservation
measures.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of continuing the CSP is that it
may be a way to support agriculture that provides more
environmental benefits than traditional crop-based subsidies
do. Conservation practices often impose significant
up-front costs, and those expenditures can reduce the net
economic output of agricultural land; CSP payments
help offset those costs.</p>
