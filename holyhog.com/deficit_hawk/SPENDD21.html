<p>Under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provides grants
to airports to expand runways, improve safety and
security, and make other capital investments. In 2010,
about 30 percent of that money went to airports that
are classified, on the basis of the number of passenger
boardings, as large and medium-sized. Those airports--
currently, there are 65, although the number fluctuates
from year to year--account for nearly 90 percent of
passenger boardings.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate the AIP's grants to large and
medium-sized airports but would continue to provide
grants to smaller airports in amounts that match funding
in 2010. That year, smaller airports received $2.4 billion,
more than two-thirds of the $3.5 billion available under
the program. Retaining only that portion of the program
would reduce federal outlays by about $4 billion through
2016 and by almost $10 billion over the 2012-2021
period.</p>

<p>The AIP, like some other transportation programs, is
treated in an unusual way in the budget. The program's
budget authority is provided in authorization acts as contract
authority, a mandatory form of budget authority.
But because the spending of contract authority is subject
to obligation limitations contained in appropriation acts,
the resulting outlays are categorized as discretionary.</p>

<p>The main rationale for this option is that federal grants
simply substitute for funds that larger airports could raise
from private sources. Because those airports serve many
passengers, they generally have been able to finance
investments through bond issues as well as passenger
facility charges and other fees. Smaller airports may have
more difficulty raising funds for capital improvements,
although some have been successful in tapping the same
sources of funding as their larger counterparts. By eliminating
grants to larger airports, this option would focus
federal spending on airports that appear to have the
fewest alternative sources of funding.</p>

<p>One argument against ending federal grants to large and
medium-sized airports is that those airports currently lack
the flexibility to substitute private sources of funding for
reduced federal grants because of provisions of federal law
that limit the amount that airports can charge passengers
to finance capital projects.</p>

<p>Another argument against ending such grants is that they
allow the FAA to retain greater control over how those
airports spend their funds by imposing conditions for aid.</p>
