<p>
To protect the quality of the nation's waters and the safety
of its drinking water, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) administers provisions of the Clean Water
Act of 1972 (CWA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act of
1974 (SDWA). Both laws authorize the federal government
to provide grants that capitalize state revolving
funds (SRFs). SRFs, in turn, offer financial assistance--
market-rate and subsidized loans, loan or bond guarantees,
and bond purchases, for example--to communities
building or replacing wastewater and drinking water systems
to meet or maintain federal standards. For 2010,
EPA received an appropriation of about $3.6 billion for
such grants, including $2.1 million for clean-water SRFs,
$1.3 billion for drinking water SRFs, and $200 million
for grants to specific communities and locales. This
option would phase out EPA's grants to SRFs over three
years, reducing federal outlays by $6 billion through
2016 and by $25 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>In 1987, amendments to the CWA phased out a program
of direct construction grants for wastewater treatment
facilities and replaced it with SRFs. States match federal
contributions to the SRFs at a rate of 20 cents on the dollar
and operate them within broad limits, defining eligible
projects, choosing the terms of assistance, and setting
priorities. In 2009, 78 percent of the loans--23 percent
of total funding from clean-water SRFs--went to communities
with populations under 10,000. Authorization
for the SRF program under the CWA has expired, but the
Congress continues to provide annual appropriations for
grants, allocating them to states according to the shares
specified in the 1987 amendments.</p>

<p>Amendments to the SDWA in 1996 authorized EPA to
make grants to capitalize SRFs for drinking water systems.
Although generally modeled on the wastewater
program, the SDWA program allocates funding using a
formula based on the results of EPA's quadrennial
"Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey." States
must establish a priority-setting system that focuses on
reducing the greatest health risks and achieving compliance
with SDWA standards, taking into account the
financial needs of local water systems.</p>

<p>One justification for this option is that the grants could
encourage inefficient decisions about water infrastructure
because they allow states to lend money at below-market
interest rates, which in turn reduces incentives for local
governments to find the least costly ways to control water
pollution and provide safe drinking water. Another
rationale is that responsibility for water systems properly
lies with state and local governments. Federal contributions
to wastewater SRFs originally were viewed as a temporary
step on the way to full state and local financing.
Moreover, those contributions may not increase total
investment in water systems if they merely replace funding
that state and local sources would have provided
otherwise.</p>

<p>An argument against such cuts is that the need to replace
aging infrastructure, improve the safety of the drinking
water, and protect the nation's waters is so great that federal
aid should be increased, not reduced. In particular,
given the budgetary pressures on states, water systems in
many small or economically disadvantaged communities
could not maintain the quality of their service and
comply with the CWA's and the SDWA's new and forth-have lower costs because of economies of scale, to charge
coming requirements without federal funding. Another rates that would pose significant hardships for low- and
