<div><a name="TAX16"></a><h1>Increase the Maximum Taxable Earnings for the Social Security Payroll Tax</h1>

<p>Social Security--which consists of Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (OASDI)--is financed by payroll
taxes on employers, employees, and the self-
employed. Only earnings up to a maximum, which is
$106,800 in 2011, are subject to the tax. That maximum
usually increases each year by the growth rate of average
wages in the economy.</p>

<p>When payroll taxes for Social Security were first collected
in 1937, about 92 percent of earnings from jobs covered
by the program were below the maximum taxable
amount. During most of the program's history, the maximum
was increased only periodically, so the percentage
varied greatly. It fell to 74 percent in 1965 and, by 1977,
was 87 percent. Amendments to the Social Security Act
in 1977 boosted the amount of covered taxable earnings,
which reached 91 percent in 1983. That law also indexed
the taxable maximum to match annual growth in average
wages. Despite those changes, the percentage of taxable
earnings has slipped in the past decade because earnings
for the highest-paid workers have grown faster than the
average. Thus, in 2009, about 83 percent of earnings
from employment covered by OASDI fell below the maximum
taxable amount.</p>

<p>This option would increase the share of total earnings
subject to the Social Security payroll tax to 90 percent by
raising the maximum taxable amount to $170,000 in
2012. (After being increased, the maximum would continue
to be indexed as it is now.) Implementing such a
policy change would increase revenues by $182 billion
from 2012 through 2016 and by $468 billion over the
2012-2021 period. (The estimates include the reduction
in individual income tax revenues that would result from
a shift of some labor compensation from a taxable to a
nontaxable form.)</p>

<p>Because Social Security's retirement benefits are tied to
the amount of income on which taxes are paid, however,
some of the increase in revenues from this option would
be offset by the additional retirement benefits paid to
people with income above the current maximum taxable
amount. On net, the option would reduce federal budget
deficits by $180 billion over the 5-year period and by
$457 billion over the 10-year period.</p>

<p>Enacting this option would enhance the long-term viability
of the Social Security program, which, according to
the Congressional Budget Office's projections, will not
have sufficient income to finance the benefits that are
due to beneficiaries under current law. CBO projects
that, in combination, the two Social Security trust funds
will be exhausted in the late 2030s. Under this option,
exhaustion of the combined trust funds would be delayed
until after 2050.</p>

<p>In addition to improving Social Security's long-term
financial outlook, this option would make the payroll tax
less regressive. People whose income is above the ceiling
now pay a smaller percentage of their total income in
payroll taxes than do people whose total earnings are
below the maximum. Making more earnings taxable
would increase payroll taxes for those high-income
earners. (Although that change also could lead to higher
benefit payments for people with earnings above the current
maximum, the additional benefits would be modest
relative to the additional taxes those earners would pay.)</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that raising the earnings
cap would weaken the link between the taxes that
workers pay into the system and the benefits they receive
(because the addition to benefits would be modest
relative to the increase in taxes). That link has been an
important aspect of Social Security since its inception.
Another drawback is that people whose earnings fall
between the existing and proposed taxable limits would
earn less after taxes for each additional hour worked,
which would reduce the incentive to work and encourage
taxpayers to substitute tax-exempt fringe benefits for
taxable wages. People whose earnings are well above the
proposed limit would not see any reduction in the return
on their additional work, but they would have less
income after taxes, which would encourage more work.</p>
