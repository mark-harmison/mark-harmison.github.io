<div><a name="SPENDD31"></a><h1>Reduce Funding for the Arts and Humanities</h1>

<p>In 2010, combined federal funding for several arts and
humanities programs that received federal subsidies was
just over $1.8 billion. Recipients of the subsidies included
the Smithsonian Institution ($761 million), the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting ($506 million), the National
Endowment for the Humanities ($168 million), the
National Endowment for the Arts ($168 million), the
National Gallery of Art ($167 million), and the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ($40 million).</p>

<p>This option would cut support for those programs by
25 percent and hold future appropriations constant at
those nominal amounts. Federal outlays would be
reduced by about $2 billion between 2012 and 2016 and
by $5 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>One argument in favor of this option is that such programs
may not provide social benefits that equal or
exceed their costs. Another argument is that certain
practices--such as charging admission at museums--
could be more widely used to help mitigate the effects of
a reduction in federal funding and that funding could be
obtained from other sources.</p>

<p>An argument against such a policy change is that a
decline in federal support would reduce activities that
preserve and advance the nation's culture and that introduce
the arts and humanities to people who might not
otherwise have access to them. The effect on the arts and
humanities nationwide would depend in large part on the
extent to which other sources of funding--such as state
and local governments, individual or corporate donors,
and foundations--boosted their contributions. But alternative
sources might not fully offset a drop in federal
funding; most state and local governments, for example,
are themselves facing tight budgetary constraints. Subsidized
projects and organizations in rural or low-income
areas might find it especially difficult to garner increased
private backing or sponsorship.</p>
