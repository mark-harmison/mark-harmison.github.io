<div><a name="TAX33"></a><h1>Impose a Fee on Large Financial Institutions</h1>

<p>During the financial crisis that occurred between 2007
and 2009, concern about the impact of the failure of large
financial institutions on the financial markets and on the
broader economy prompted federal action. The government
provided substantial assistance to major financial
institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program,
the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). That action effectively
protected many uninsured creditors of large financial
institutions from losses but at great potential cost to taxpayers.
It also reinforced investors' perceptions that large
financial firms are "too big to fail"--that is, so important
to the financial system that their creditors are likely be
protected by the federal government in case of large
losses.</p>

<p>Banks and other large financial institutions benefit from a
federal financial safety net, but they do not bear the full
cost of that protection. The vast majority of the funds
that financial institutions lend is obtained from creditors,
which for commercial banks include insured and uninsured
depositors, and purchasers of bank commercial
paper (short-term debt obligations) and other bank debt
(such as bonds). Deposits (saving and checking accounts
and certificates of deposit) are one of the most important
sources of funding for small and medium-sized banks and
are insured against losses (generally up to $250,000 per
account) by the FDIC. Banks pay a premium for FDIC
insurance and also are obligated to make up for losses that
exceed the reserves of the FDIC. Large financial institutions,
including big banks, are much more likely than
smaller banks to obtain financing from sources other than
insured deposits. They also are more likely to be perceived
as too big to fail. Those implicit federal guarantees,
which large financial institutions do not pay for
under current law, give them a cost advantage over
smaller banks in the form of lower borrowing costs.</p>

<p>This option would assess an annual fee on banks, thrifts,
brokers, security dealers, and U.S. holding companies
that control such entities. The fee would apply only to
firms with consolidated assets of more than $50 billion.
(Consolidated assets include all assets controlled by the
financial institution's parent company and all of its subsidiaries.)
The option would impose a fee at an annual
rate of 0.15 percent on the firm's total liabilities as
reported in their financial statements, excluding deposits
insured by the FDIC (for banks) and certain reserves
required by insurance policies (for insurance companies).
If implemented, such a policy change would generate
$31 billion in revenue from 2012 through 2016 and
$71 billion from 2012 through 2021. (Such fees would
reduce the tax base of income and payroll taxes, leading
to reductions in income and payroll tax revenues. The
estimates shown here reflect those reductions.)</p>

<p>At 0.15 percent, the fee would probably not be so high as
to cause financial institutions to significantly change their
financial structure or activities. The fee could affect to
some extent institutions' tendency to take various risks,
but the net direction of that effect is uncertain. On the
one hand, the fee could reduce the profitability of larger
institutions, which might create an incentive for them to
take greater risks in pursuit of higher returns to offset
their higher costs. On the other hand, the fee would provide
an incentive for larger financial institutions to reduce
their dependence on liabilities subject to the fee. To the
extent that institutions increased their reliance on equity
and did not change their investment strategies, the risk
of future losses would be reduced. The amount of the
fee could vary with the amount of risk an institution
undertakes, but it might be difficult to measure those risk
factors precisely.</p>

<p>The fee also might affect the market concentration of the
financial industry. Banks would have an incentive to keep
assets below the $50 billion threshold, which could
reduce the number of large institutions. The fee also
would improve the relative competitive position of small
and medium-sized banks.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this option is that it would help
compensate taxpayers for the cost of providing large institutions
with a financial safety net. It would also create a
more level playing field for large and small financial institutions,
by charging the largest institutions for the greater
government protection they receive. By applying the fee
to noninsured liabilities, the option would allocate costs
from government rescue actions more evenly across the
sources of funding.</p>

<p>The option would also have several disadvantages. The
fee might be borne by unintended groups: Large financial
institutions could pass much of the cost to their customers,
employees, and investors, but the precise incidence
among those groups is uncertain. In addition, unless
the fee was risked-based, stronger financial institutions
that pay lower interest rates on their debt would face a
proportionally greater increase in funding costs than
would weaker financial institutions. Furthermore, more-
stringent regulations such as those in the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010 and those in the international Basel III agreement
could better protect taxpayers from the risks of large-bank
failures than would be the case under previous rules.
If so, those regulations would reduce the need to charge
large banks a fee to offset the potential costs of being
"too big to fail."</p>
