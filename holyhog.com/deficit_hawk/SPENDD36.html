<div><a name="SPENDD36"></a><h1>Reduce Funding for Certain Department of Justice Grants</h1>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) carries out law
enforcement activities directly, but it also has five grant
programs that assist nonprofit community organizations
and state and local law enforcement agencies, each of
which is funded in a separate account in the federal budget.
The programs are as follows: State and Local Law
Enforcement Assistance, Justice Assistance, Juvenile Justice,
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS),
and Violence Against Women.</p>

<p>Funding for those programs totaled about $2.5 billion
annually over the 2006-2008 period; nearly $7 billion in
2009, including $4.0 billion provided in the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law
111-5); and $3.3 billion in 2010. In its baseline projection,
the Congressional Budget Office estimates that
spending will be $4.2 billion in 2011 if full-year funding
is equal to the appropriation for the first several months
annualized. This option would reduce financial assistance
from the five grant programs by 25 percent relative to
CBO's baseline projection for the next 5 years, reducing
spending by almost $3 billion between 2012 and 2016
and by about $7 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>Grant recipients currently use these funds for an array of
activities, including the purchase of body armor and
other equipment for law enforcement officers and the
improvement of DNA analysis and other forensic activities
conducted by state and local police agencies. Other
supported activities include substance abuse treatment
programs for prisoners; funding for Boys and Girls
Clubs; research, development, and evaluation of state justice
programs; and the collection and analysis of statistics
and information on the judiciary. For some grants, recipients
must contribute funds toward the total cost of the
program. Under this option, those activities would be
scaled back or funded in other ways.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of the option is that the five grant
programs address law enforcement issues that are primarily
local, and therefore funding at the local level would
lead to a more efficient allocation of resources. Another
argument is that resources provided by these programs in
the past may have been used inefficiently and that future
financial assistance could be scaled back substantially
with few consequences for the nation's law enforcement
capabilities. For example, the Government Accountability
Office has reported that grants awarded through the
COPS program made only a modest contribution to
declines in crime in the 1990s.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that given the financial
constraints facing state and local governments, it would
be difficult for them to compensate for the loss of federal
funds. The problems the grant programs address have
national elements, and state and local governments might
neglect such problems because of the scarcity of
resources. Therefore, some people argue, such federal
assistance helps make many communities safer.</p>
