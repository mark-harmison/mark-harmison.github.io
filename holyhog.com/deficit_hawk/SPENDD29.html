<p>National community service programs provide financial
assistance to students and other volunteers who aid their
communities in the areas of education, public safety, the
environment, and health care, among others. In fiscal
year 2010, appropriations for national service programs
totaled about $1.1 billion, which supported the following
initiatives: the AmeriCorps Grants Program, the Ameri-
Corps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC)
program, the AmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America
(VISTA) program, Learn and Serve America, the
National Senior Service Corps, and the National Service
Trust. In addition, AmeriCorps receives supplemental
funding from state and local governments and from private
sources for service projects that, in many cases, build
on existing federal, state, and local programs. Participants
in the AmeriCorps Grants Program, NCCC, and VISTA
may receive an educational allowance, a stipend for living
expenses, and access to health insurance and child care
subsidies. Learn and Serve America participants generally
do not receive such stipends or awards.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate federal funding for national
service programs, reducing outlays by $4 billion through
2016 and by $10 billion over the coming 10 years.
(Those estimates account for the administrative costs
associated with terminating the programs.)</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that funding community
service programs by local governments might be
more efficient than funding them at the federal level
because the benefits of community service accrue locally
rather than nationally. From that standpoint, decisions
about such programs--the types of service projects to
undertake and the amount of funding to provide, for
instance--would be made more efficiently by the community
that receives the benefits. Another rationale for
eliminating student-focused national service programs is
that a goal of federal aid to students is to provide low-
income people with access to postsecondary education.
Because participation in those programs is not based on
family income or assets, funds do not necessarily go to
the poorest students.</p>

<p>An argument against implementing this option is that the
programs provide opportunities for participants of all
socioeconomic backgrounds to engage in public service.
In addition, relative to other approaches, the programs
may offer a cost-effective way of providing community
services because of the low budgetary cost per hour of
service provided.</p>
