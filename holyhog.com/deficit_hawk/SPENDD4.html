<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) provides medical
care to military beneficiaries through the TRICARE program,
which combines access to military hospitals and
clinics with coverage for services received from civilian
health care providers. Currently, military retirees and
their dependents who are not yet eligible for Medicare
represent about 40 percent of the TRICARE-eligible
population. Those beneficiaries may use one of three
plans: TRICARE Standard (a fee-for-service plan allowing
free choice of providers but subject to coinsurance
and deductibles), TRICARE Extra (a preferred provider
plan offering lower coinsurance when using network providers),
or TRICARE Prime (a managed care plan with
lower out-of-pocket costs but a small annual enrollment
fee).1 About three-quarters of all retired military beneficiaries
not yet eligible for Medicare have access to
employer-sponsored insurance through civilian employment.
2 Because the out-of-pocket cost of TRICARE coverage
has grown much more slowly since 1995 than the
corresponding costs under insurance provided by most
civilian employers, many of those beneficiaries have
dropped their employer-sponsored coverage in favor of
full-time reliance on TRICARE. In 1999, 55 percent of
military retirees and their dependents had signed up for
other health insurance, but by 2009 that figure had
dropped to 29 percent. TRICARE spending more than
doubled in real terms over that same 10-year period.</p>

<p>This option would preclude military retirees and their
dependents from enrolling in TRICARE Prime, which is
the TRICARE option with the lowest out-of-pocket
cost.3 Military retirees and their dependents could enroll
in TRICARE Standard or Extra during the annual open
enrollment period or when a life event occurred (for
example, a change in marital status, birth of a child, or
change in employment status). Enrollees would pay a
monthly enrollment fee that would be set at 28 percent of
the cost of providing benefits for that group, to be
updated annually based on the average cost the group
incurred in the previous year. In addition, the catastrophic
cap (maximum out-of-pocket expenses) for military
retirees and their dependents would be raised from
the current $3,000 per family to $7,500 per family, the
level at which it was set before January 2002. That catastrophic
cap would increase in future years, with changes
indexed to nationwide growth in per capita health care
spending.</p>

<p>Military retirees and their dependents would still have the
option of seeking care at no cost on a space-available basis
at military treatment facilities. However, such patients are
considered lower priority than active-duty service members
and their dependents, and as a result, they might
have difficulty obtaining such space-available care. For
that reason, military retirees and their dependents would
have an incentive to obtain other coverage rather than
rely on military treatment facilities as their main source of
medical care.</p>

<p>Those changes in TRICARE coverage options for military
retirees and their families would bring the value of
TRICARE coverage closer to that of health plans available
through civilian employment. The Congressional
Budget Office anticipates that among this group of beneficiaries,
the share relying entirely on TRICARE would
drop by half, from 71 percent to 35 percent. In addition,
for those who did not enroll and pay an annual premium,
TRICARE would no longer act as secondary payer to
civilian health insurance, thereby reducing federal outlays
for the 29 percent of beneficiaries who currently have
civilian health insurance (and who presumably would
continue that coverage). For those who do enroll in
TRICARE, the higher cost sharing under TRICARE
Standard or Extra (as compared with TRICARE Prime)
would reduce the use of health care services by many beneficiaries.
However, some retirees and their dependents
might turn to other federal programs for which they may
be eligible rather than to private civilian options. As a
result, CBO anticipates that some additional costs would
be incurred by the Veterans Health Administration, the
Medicaid program, and the Federal Employees Health
Benefits plan.</p>

<p>CBO estimates that this change would reduce discretionary
outlays by $39 billion over the 2012-2016 period
and by $105 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>CBO projects that approximately 35 percent of military
retirees and their dependents would sign up for
TRICARE under the new rules outlined in this option
and that increases in cost sharing would also result in a
decrease in DoD's per capita spending on that group of
beneficiaries. CBO estimates that the change would
increase mandatory spending for the Medicaid program
and for health benefits for annuitants by $4 billion over
the 2012-2021 period. (Total costs would be greater, but
some have already been incorporated in the baseline. See
the note to the above table.) The estimates do not include
the reduction in the individual income and payroll tax
revenues that might result from a shift of some labor
compensation from a taxable to a nontaxable form.</p>

<p>One rationale for this option is that TRICARE coverage
and space-available care at military treatment facilities
were originally considered a supplement or a safety net to
ensure the availability of health care for military retirees
and their dependents, not as a replacement for benefits
offered by postservice civilian employers. The rapid
increase in TRICARE spending since 1999 can be traced
in part to a migration of retirees from civilian to
TRICARE coverage. In an era of fiscal constraint, rapidly
rising health care costs may result in fewer resources available
for DoD to purchase and maintain weapon systems
and other equipment or to use for other defense budget
priorities. This option would begin to curtail the growth
in health care costs, freeing those resources for other
important uses.</p>

<p>An argument against changing access to TRICARE coverage
for military retirees and their dependents is that
those retirees made decisions about continuing their
period of active-duty service with the understanding that
they would receive free or very low-cost medical care after
retiring from the military. Significant limitations on TRICARE
coverage for military retirees and their dependents
would impose a financial cost on many of those beneficiaries
and could adversely affect military retention.</p>
