<div><a name="SPENDD23"></a><h1>Eliminate Intercity Rail Subsidies</h1>

<p>Including funds appropriated in the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, Public Law 111-5), the
Congress appropriated more than $14 billion to subsidize
intercity passenger rail services in 2009 and 2010. About
$4 billion has been allocated for the National Railroad
Passenger Corporation--or Amtrak--and about $10 billion
is available both to Amtrak and to state and local
governments to fund high-speed and intercity regional
rail service. In 1970, when the Congress established
Amtrak, it anticipated subsidizing the railroad only for a
short time, until it became self-supporting. Over the past
40 years, however, the federal subsidy to Amtrak has
amounted to approximately $40 billion cumulatively.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate federal subsidies not only
for Amtrak but also for high-speed and other intercity rail
service, yielding savings of $11 billion over the next
5 years and $30 billion over 10 years. (Not included in
those estimates are potential savings that could be
obtained by rescinding unobligated funds provided in
ARRA. The savings would depend on the amount of
funds still unobligated when the legislation was enacted,
but could be on the order of $1 billion to $2 billion.)</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that intercity
passenger rail service should be provided only if it is a
self-supporting commercial service. It is also argued that
current federal spending represents just a small down
payment on a much larger expenditure that would be
necessary to build a large high-speed rail system--such as
one that would meet the Administration's goal of making
high-speed rail available to 80 percent of Americans--
and that the total costs of the system would exceed its
benefits, both of which are highly uncertain.</p>

<p>With respect to Amtrak, a rationale for this option is that
eliminating its federal subsidy would encourage its managers
to cut unprofitable services and routes and focus
instead on those that are profitable and in high demand.
One example of an unprofitable service that could be cut
is sleeper-class service. The Inspector General of the
Department of Transportation estimates that eliminating
sleeper service would save Amtrak $75 million to
$158 million annually, net of lost revenues from customers
who would no longer travel by train if sleeper service
was discontinued. Large savings could also accrue from
eliminating unprofitable routes. According to Amtrak's
Performance Tracking System, the five most unprofitable
routes account for combined annual losses of roughly
$260 million, although some of that amount represents
allocated overhead costs that would continue to be
incurred if the lines were eliminated.</p>

<p>An argument against eliminating support for intercity
passenger rail is that the amount of such support needs to
be analyzed in the context of the budgetary and social
costs of travel by highways and air--namely, that highway
and air travel are subsidized even though they involve
higher safety risks and greater emissions of greenhouse
gases. Also, eliminating federal support could require
Amtrak to greatly reduce its route network. Some opponents
of this option regard rail service as a public service
that should be widely available. They maintain that passengers
on lightly traveled routes have few transportation
alternatives and that Amtrak is vital to the survival of
small communities along those routes. Continuing federal
support could help Amtrak and other passenger rail
carriers improve service, attract more passengers, and
make rail transportation more viable economically.</p>
