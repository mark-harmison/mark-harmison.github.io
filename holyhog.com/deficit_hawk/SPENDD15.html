<div><a name="SPENDD15"></a><h1>Eliminate the Department of Energy's Grants to States for Energy Conservation and Weatherization</h1>

<p>The Weatherization and Intergovernmental Program,
which is administered by the Department of Energy
(DOE), provides grants that help fund state and local
government programs for energy conservation and the
weatherization of buildings. Some grants provide low-
income households with insulation, storm windows, and
weather stripping. Institutional grants help reduce energy
use at educational, municipal, and health care facilities
and fund local efforts to encourage private investment in
building improvements. Other grants support efforts by
state and municipal governments to establish energy-
efficiency standards for new and remodeled buildings
and to promote energy-saving practices such as carpooling
and the use of public transportation. In 2010,
DOE received regular appropriations of about $230 million
to provide grants to states and municipalities for
energy conservation and building weatherization. The
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(ARRA, Public Law 111-5) provided an additional
$8.1 billion.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate new funding for the grants
that DOE provides to state and local governments
through its Weatherization and Intergovernmental
Program. Ending that funding would save about
$900 million over the next five years and more than
$2 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>One rationale for eliminating new funding for the grants
is that the funding provided in 2009 should be sufficient
to cover several years' worth of weatherization activity;
the appropriation provided by ARRA was roughly eight
times the normal amount of funding provided in an average
year for weatherization activities across all federal
programs. Another rationale is that other federal
programs--such as the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program, which is administered by the
Department of Health and Human Services, and DOE's
own Building Energy Codes Program--are doing similar
work. Moreover, direct federal funding may encourage
state and local governments to reduce their own support
for energy conservation and weatherization and to
redirect that support to other uses. In the extreme, if
federal funding simply substituted dollar-for-dollar for
what a state or local government otherwise would have
spent, then that federal spending would have no net
effect on energy conservation.</p>

<p>One argument against such a policy change is that many
states rely heavily on federal grants to improve the energy
efficiency of low-income housing and public institutions.
Eliminating DOE's energy conservation and weatherization
grants could make it harder for states to continue to
promote such efforts. A second argument is that the
grants support policies the federal government should
consider a priority--specifically, those designed to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants
from natural gas and electric power generation. Eliminating
the DOE grant program could result in fewer
resources being allocated for such purposes. Finally,
weatherization and energy conservation limit the effects
that higher energy prices have on public and household
budgets. Ending DOE's grants would have a particularly
adverse impact on the programs' beneficiaries--primarily
low-income households (who devote a larger-thanaverage
share of their income to energy bills) and public
institutions--especially if energy prices were to rise over
time.</p>
