<div><a name="TAX9"></a><h1>Include Investment Income from Life Insurance and Annuities in Taxable Income</h1>

<p>Certain types of life insurance policies and annuities
combine features of insurance and tax-favored savings
accounts. (An annuity is a contract with an insurance
company under which, in exchange for premiums, the
company agrees to make fixed or variable payments
to a person at a future time, usually during retirement.)
Portions of the premiums paid for certain types of insurance
policies, such as whole-life polices, and for annuities
are invested and earn interest, dividends, and other types
of investment income. (A whole-life policy is a contract
with an insurance company that provides life insurance
coverage throughout the policyholder's lifetime--not
just for a specified period, as is the case with term life
insurance.) That investment income, sometimes called
inside buildup, is generally not included in taxable
income until it is paid out to the policyholder as a return
of cash value or as a recurring payment. If the inside
buildup is used to reduce premiums in later years (as
occurs with whole-life policies) or is paid out because of
the death of the insured, it can escape taxation under the
income tax.</p>

<p>Under this option, life insurance companies would
inform policyholders annually of the investment income
their accounts have realized, just as mutual funds do now,
and policyholders would include those amounts in their
taxable income for that year. In turn, the cash value from
life insurance policies and recurring payments from
annuities would not be taxed when they were paid out.
That approach would make the tax treatment of investment
income from life insurance and annuities match the
treatment of income from bank accounts, taxable bonds,
or mutual funds. (Taxes on investment income from
annuities purchased as part of a qualified pension plan or
qualified individual retirement account would still be
deferred until benefits were paid.) Such changes in tax
treatment would increase revenues by $117 billion from
2012 through 2016 and by $260 billion from 2012
through 2021. Those revenue gains would diminish
over time, however, relative to the size of the economy,
because taxes paid on the inside buildup would mean that
future payouts were tax-exempt.</p>

<p>By taxing the investment income from life insurance and
annuities as it was realized, this option would eliminate a
tax incentive to purchase such insurance products.
Whether that outcome would be a benefit or a drawback
depends on whether the current incentive is considered
beneficial. Encouraging the purchase of life insurance is
useful if people buy too little because they underestimate
the financial hardship that their death will impose on
their families. Encouraging the purchase of annuities is
helpful if people tend to underestimate their retirement
spending or life span and thus buy too little annuity
insurance to protect against outliving their assets.
However, scant evidence exists about how successful
the current tax treatment is in encouraging people to
obtain adequate amounts of insurance.</p>

<p>If providing an incentive to purchase life insurance is
indeed considered a useful part of the tax system, an
alternative approach would be to encourage such purchases
directly by giving people a tax credit for their life
insurance premiums or by allowing them to deduct part
of those premiums from their taxable income. Either
alternative would encourage people to purchase term
insurance as well as whole-life policies. (Term insurance,
which accounts for a large proportion of all life insurance
policies, earns no inside buildup and so does not benefit
from the same favorable tax treatment. Term insurance
provides coverage for a specified period and pays benefits
only if the policyholder dies during the term. Otherwise,
the policy expires without value.)</p>

<p>A disadvantage of taxing inside buildup is that the people
who would be affected would not have access to the
buildup to pay the tax. People who had accumulated
considerable savings from contributions to whole-life
policies or annuities could owe substantial amounts of is currently taxed in a manner that is similar to the treat-
taxes relative to the cash income from which they would ment of capital gains, in that the gains are not taxed until
have to pay the taxes. (That is one reason inside buildup the investor sells the asset.)
