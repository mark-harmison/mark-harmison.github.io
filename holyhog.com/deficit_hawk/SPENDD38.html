<div><a name="SPENDD38"></a><h1>Impose Fees to Cover the Cost of Government Regulation and Charge for Services Provided to the Private Sector</h1>

<p>Federal law imposes a variety of regulations on private
individuals and businesses to ensure the health and safety
of the public and to facilitate commerce. The federal government
also provides the private sector with a wide array
of services and allows the use of public assets that have
economic value, such as navigable waterways and grazing
land. This volume includes a number of budget options
that would raise substantial amounts of income over five
years by imposing fees on users of certain services or
otherwise charging for those services. For example,
Discretionary Spending--Option 22, would increase the
fees that cover the cost of aviation security by about
$10 billion over five years; and Discretionary Spending--
Option 32 would support the regulatory functions performed
by the Food Safety and Inspection Service by
expanding collections, which would raise $5 billion from
2012 through 2016. A number of other fees or taxes that
raise smaller amounts could be imposed either to cover
the cost to the government of administering regulations
or to ensure that the government is compensated for the
value of services currently provided to the private sector.
Those fees could be applied across a wide array of federal
agencies and through a variety of programs.</p>

<p>This option encompasses an illustrative group of relatively
small fees and taxes that could be implemented
independently. However, if all were put in place, they
could increase income to the government by $3 billion
from 2012 through 2016 and by $8 billion over the
2012-2021 period. Each of the fees in that group
appeared as an individual option in CBO's Budget
Options: Volume 2 (August 2009).</p>

<p>Depending on the way the legislation was written, the
fees included in this option could be recorded as revenues
or as collections that would then be subtracted from
either discretionary or mandatory spending. Several of
the specific fees listed in this option would normally be
classified as revenues, consistent with the guidance provided
by the 1967 President's Commission on Budget
Concepts. That guidance indicates that receipts from a
fee that is imposed under the federal government's sovereign
power to assess charges for governmental activities
should generally be recorded as revenues. If that treatment
were to apply to any of these specific fee options,
the amounts shown in the table would be recorded as revenues
and adjusted downward to account for their effect
of shrinking the tax base for income and payroll taxes
and, thus, of reducing revenues from those sources. However,
the Congress has sometimes legislated the budgetary
classification of fees, specifying that they be recorded as
offsets to spending when they otherwise would have been
recorded as revenues.</p>

<p>A rationale for user charges is that private businesses
should cover all of their costs of doing business, including
the costs of ensuring the safety of their activities and
products--for example, the Federal Railroad Administration's
costs for rail safety activities, and the Environmental
Protection Agency's costs to register pesticides and
new chemicals. In addition, the private sector should
compensate the government for the market value of services
it benefits from, such as the dredging of the inland
waterway system, and for using or acquiring resources on
public lands, such as grasslands for grazing and mineral
deposits. In that view, it is unfair to taxpayers and a net
drain on the productivity of the economy for businesses
to provide products or services that cannot be priced high
enough to cover those costs.</p>

<p>An argument against setting fees to cover the cost of regulation
and recover the value of public services and
resources is that some of the products and services provided
by private businesses are beneficial to people not
involved in producing or consuming those products and
services; thus, it is both fair and efficient for taxpayers to
subsidize the provision of those benefits. For example, by
lowering the cost of rail transportation, taxpayers' support
for rail safety activities reduces highway congestion
and emissions of greenhouse gases; support for the registration
of new chemicals reduces the use of older chemicals
that may be more damaging to public health and to
the environment; and not charging tolls on the portion of
the St. Lawrence Seaway that is controlled by the United
States supports the economies of port communities on
the Great Lakes.</p>
