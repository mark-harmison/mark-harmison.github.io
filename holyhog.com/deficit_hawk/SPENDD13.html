<div><a name="SPENDD13"></a><h1>Terminate the Precision Tracking Space System Program</h1>

<p>The Precision Tracking Space System (PTSS), currently
being designed by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), is
intended to be a constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites
that track enemy ballistic missiles and distinguish enemy
warheads from decoys (a process known as discrimination).
The newest in a set of evolving concepts for missile
defense that relies on satellite-based infrared tracking, the
program supersedes the Space Tracking and Surveillance
System (STSS) program. The design of PTSS will draw
on knowledge gained from two STSS demonstration satellites,
which were launched in September 2009 and are
gathering data that will be used to assess the performance
of onboard sensors. Existing plans call for one or more
PTSS prototypes to be fielded initially, followed shortly
by an operational constellation of 6 to 12 satellites.</p>

<p>This option would terminate the PTSS program. To estimate
the savings from ending the program, the Congressional
Budget Office assumed that the operational constellation
would consist of 9 satellites, with the first to be
launched in about 2019. Estimated savings would be
about $1 billion over the next five years and about
$7.5 billion over a decade. The 10-year savings would be
realized by not starting research and development for the
new satellites (about $2.5 billion) and by not buying,
launching, and operating them (almost $5 billion).
CBO's estimates do not include any savings that might
arise from not building and launching replacement satellites
after the initial constellation reached the end of its
design life. (Construction of replacement satellites would
begin within the next decade if the design life of the
PTSS satellite was less than seven years.)</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that the feasibility
of operating infrared sensors in space for the purposes of
discrimination has not yet been established. Another
argument is that the constellation might not provide
enough added value to justify the cost because programs
that MDA and the Air Force plan to operate simultaneously
with the PTSS also would provide some ability to
track and discriminate enemy warheads. MDA has
recently developed and fielded deployable surface-based
radars for missile defense, including the Sea-Based
X-Band (SBX) and the AN/TPY-2 radar systems, and has
upgraded several early-warning radars to enhance the
nation's ability to track ballistic missiles. MDA's plans to
deploy surface-based radar close to Iran and North Korea
will provide tracking and discrimination information
much earlier in the flight of ballistic missiles from those
countries than have previous approaches. MDA has also
begun research into using infrared sensors onboard
unmanned aerial vehicles to track ballistic missiles. In
addition, the Air Force is improving its missile-warning
capability with the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS)High
constellation--satellites in highly elliptical orbits
are currently in operation, and the first launch of a
SBIRS-High GEO (geosynchronous) satellite is planned
for 2011. The sensors on those satellites will also be able
to track ballistic missiles early in their flight.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that the data being
gathered from the STSS demonstration satellites might
show that space-based infrared sensors would be effective
and valuable for tracking and discriminating warheads
launched on enemy ballistic missiles. Reliance on a combination
of ground-based radars and airborne infrared
systems would probably not match the broad geographic
coverage offered by a full constellation of PTSS satellites
and thus would reduce the nation's ability to track ballistic
missiles through all phases of flight for some missile
trajectories. The PTSS may also have greater capability to
track missile salvos--multiple missiles launched nearly
simultaneously--than those other systems.</p>
