<div><a name="TAX2"></a><h1>Raise Tax Rates on Capital Gains</h1>

<p>
When individuals sell an asset for more than the purchase
price, they generally realize a capital gain that is subject to
taxation. Most taxable capital gains are realized from the
sale of corporate stocks, other financial assets, real estate,
and unincorporated businesses. Long-term capital
gains--those realized on assets held for more than a
year--are taxed at various rates, most of them below the
rates applied to other types of income (typically referred
to as ordinary income). The tax rate depends on the year
in which the taxpayer realizes the gain, the type of asset,
how long the asset has been held, and the taxpayer's other
income.</p>

<p>For example, in 2013, under current law, a taxpayer who
is in the 28 percent tax bracket, or higher, for ordinary
income and who sells corporate stock owned for more
than a year will pay a basic tax rate of 20 percent on the
realized gain.1 For taxpayers in the 15 percent tax bracket,
the comparable basic rate is 10 percent. If the stock has
been held for more than five years, special tax rates
apply--generally, 18 percent for higher-income taxpayers
and 8 percent for taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket.</p>

<p>The tax rate on gains realized from many other assets is
the same as that for corporate stock. However, special tax
treatment is allowed under certain circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Lower rates apply to gains on the sale of stock of certain small businesses that are held for more than five
years, and gains from the sale of such stock can be
deferred if other small-business stock is purchased.</li>
<li>
Under certain circumstances, taxpayers (including
corporations) can defer paying taxes on gains from the
sale of assets held for "productive use or investment"
(rental cars or real estate, for instance), if they purchase
a similar--"like-kind"--property.</li>
<li>
When real estate is sold, the capital gain is measured as
the difference between the sale price and the adjusted
basis, which is the purchase price less deductions for
depreciation that were previously claimed. (Generally,
taxpayers cannot claim deductions for depreciation on
owner-occupied housing.) The portion of the gain
that is equal to the deductions for depreciation is taxed
at ordinary rates up to a maximum rate of 25 percent.
(The remaining gains are taxed in the same manner as
corporate stocks.)</li>
<li>
Profits from the sale of livestock are taxed as capital
gains, even though such income--usually earned in
the course of operating a business--is similar to other
types of ordinary income earned by businesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beginning in 2013, this option would raise the basic tax
rates on realized gains by 2 percentage points--from
20 percent to 22 percent for people in the 28 percent tax
bracket or higher and from 10 percent to 12 percent for
those in the 15 percent bracket. The special rates for
assets held for more than five years, including those for
small-business stock, would be repealed. Gains realized
after the sale of an asset that was held for productive use
or investment could no longer be deferred when the taxpayer
purchased a like-kind asset; similarly, no deferral
would be allowed when an investor purchased equity in a
small business after selling stock in another small firm.
The recapture of depreciation from real estate gains
would be taxed as ordinary income, without any ceilings
on the tax rates. Finally, profits from the sale of livestock
also would be treated as ordinary income and taxed as
such. If implemented, the changes outlined in this option
would raise revenues by a total of $10 billion from 2012
through 2016 and by $49 billion from 2012 through
2021.</p>

<p>An advantage of disallowing special tax treatment for certain
types of assets is that it could improve economic efficiency
by encouraging investors to focus more on economic
factors than on the tax advantages associated with
different types of investments. When tax rates are lower
on assets held for at least five years, taxpayers may hold
on to those assets longer just to lower their tax liability--
even though it might make sense to sell sooner, given
economic conditions. Another example is that current
law allows taxpayers to defer gains when switching from
one real estate investment to another, thus encouraging
investment in land and buildings rather than in stocks
and other financial assets where deferral is not allowed. In
addition, recapturing depreciation deductions as ordinary
income would reduce the tax advantage accorded to people
in the highest tax brackets who invest in real estate.
Simplification of the tax system is another argument for
eliminating the special treatment of various assets; with
fewer exceptions, most people would find it easier to
compute capital gains taxes.</p>

<p>Increasing the basic tax rates on capital gains from corporate
stock and most other assets--rather than on ordinary
income--also could encourage people to base investment
decisions on economic factors rather than on tax advantages.
For example, the tax code will encourage businesses
to retain profits rather than paying them out as dividends
after 2012, when dividends will once again be taxed as
ordinary income. By raising the rates on capital gains,
the option would reduce that incentive to retain profits.
Furthermore, by reducing the difference between the tax
rates on ordinary income and those on realized capital
gains, people would have less incentive to engage in tax
planning to characterize compensation and profit as a
capital gain.</p>

<p>Raising the rates at which capital gains were taxed also
could have a negative effect on economic efficiency, however,
even if those rates were applied uniformly. Raising
rates would discourage some people from selling assets
when doing so makes sense for economic reasons.
Instead, people would hold on to the assets longer to
defer the tax--or they might avoid taxes altogether by
passing the asset on to their heirs when they die. (The
resulting decline in the sales of assets would also reduce
the amount of revenue that could potentially be collected
from the higher capital gains tax rates.)</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of the option is that lower rates on
certain types of capital gains may reduce barriers to
investment. Capital gains from the sale of a stock often
occur because a corporation reinvested profits--which
were already taxed under the corporate income tax--in
the business. A lower tax rate on such gains would mitigate
that double taxation of profits, which discourages
equity investment in the corporate sector. Yet another
reason for taxing some forms of capital gains at lower
rates is that investors may view certain investments--
such as starting a new business or investing in a new technology--
as too risky and thus undervalue their benefits
for the economy. A drawback of recapturing the depreciation
deductions on real estate is that some depreciation
probably occurred, reducing the value of the property
since the time of purchase. Finally, denying deferral on
like-kind exchanges would increase the tax burden on
people who rent out property in their own community
but must sell it when they have to move to another
community.</p>
