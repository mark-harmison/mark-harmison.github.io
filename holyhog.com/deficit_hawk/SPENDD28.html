<div><a name="SPENDD28"></a><h1>Restrict Pell Grants to the Neediest Students</h1>

<p>The Pell Grant program is the single largest source of federal
grant aid to low-income students for postsecondary
undergraduate education. For the 2010-2011 academic
year, the program is estimated to provide almost $37 billion
in aid to about 8.9 million students. A student's Pell
Grant eligibility is chiefly determined on the basis of
Expected Family Contribution (EFC), a federal calculation
of his or her family's ability to pay for postsecondary
education. The EFC is based on factors such as the student's
income and assets and, for dependent students (in
general, unmarried undergraduate students under the age
of 24), the parents' income and assets, as well as the number
of other dependent children in the family attending
postsecondary schools. Generally, families with high
EFCs have less financial need than those with low EFCs
and are able to contribute more to their child's education.</p>

<p>Since 2008, funding for the Pell Grant program has had
both a discretionary and a mandatory component. Mandatory
funding supports automatic increases to the maximum
award set in each fiscal year's appropriation act. The
automatic increase for the 2010-2011 award year is
$690, which, when added to the maximum award of
$4,860 set in the appropriation act, results in a total maximum
award of $5,550.</p>

<p>Under current law, students with an EFC exceeding
95 percent of the total maximum Pell grant award
($5,273 for academic year 2010-2011) are ineligible for a
grant. This option would make students with an EFC
exceeding $2,500 ineligible for a Pell grant. Assuming
that, under current law, the maximum discretionary
award level specified in appropriation acts would remain
at $4,860 in future years, the Congressional Budget
Office estimates that this option would yield discretionary
savings of $2 billion through 2016 and $7 billion
through 2021, along with accompanying mandatory savings
of about $1 billion through 2016 and $5 billion
through 2021.</p>

<p>A rationale in favor of this option is that it would focus
federal aid on those students with the greatest need. Furthermore,
students who lose eligibility under the option
would probably still be able to afford a public two-year
college according to federal needs analysis. Tuition and
fees at public two-year colleges for the 2008-2009 academic
year averaged about $2,140, which is still below
the EFC of students who would lose eligibility under this
option. Those students may also be eligible for $3,500 or
more in federal student loans that are interest-free while
students are enrolled.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that among Pell grant
recipients with an EFC above $2,500, significant educational
expenses are not covered by their EFC or by
federal, state, institutional, or other aid. For example,
70 percent of those students had expenses that were not
covered by those sources. Denying Pell grants to those
students would further increase the financial burden of
obtaining an undergraduate education and might cause
some to choose less postsecondary education or to forgo
it altogether. The amount of postsecondary education
received is an important determinant of future wages. In
2009, for example, the median wage for men ages 16 to
64 with bachelor's degrees was 72 percent more than the
median wage for men with only high school diplomas or
GEDs.</p>
