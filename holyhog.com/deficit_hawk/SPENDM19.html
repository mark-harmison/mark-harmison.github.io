<div><a name="SPENDM19"></a><h1>Impose Cost Sharing for the First 20 Days of a Stay in a Skilled Nursing Facility Under Medicare</h1>

<p>For enrollees who have been hospitalized and need continuing
skilled nursing care or rehabilitation services on a
daily basis, Medicare currently covers up to 100 days of
care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) for each episode of
care. There is no deductible for SNF care and no copayment
for the first 20 days of each stay. A daily copayment
is required for days 21 through 100; that copayment is set
at 12.5 percent of the hospital inpatient deductible and is
projected to be about $148 in 2013. A substantial share
of Medicare SNF stays are shorter than 20 days and
therefore do not require any copayment. The Congressional
Budget Office projects that total Medicare spending
for SNF services will rise from about $30 billion in 2012
to $60 billion in 2021.</p>

<p>Beginning in 2013, this option would impose a copayment
for each of the first 20 days of care in a skilled nursing
facility equal to 5 percent of the inpatient deductible;
that copayment is projected to be about $59 per day in
2013. The maximum additional liability for each SNF
stay would thus equal the inpatient deductible, which
CBO projects will be $1,184 in 2013. Imposing that
copayment would reduce federal outlays by about $8 billion
over the 2012-2016 period and by $21 billion over
the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>The effect of this option on the use of SNF services and
on beneficiaries' out-of-pocket payments would depend
on whether participants had supplemental coverage.
Most individual medigap policies include full coverage of
current SNF copayments, so most beneficiaries with such
policies would be insulated from the direct impact of the</p>

<p>higher copayments--but they would face higher medigap
premiums to reflect the average cost of covering those
payments. Employers' spending on supplemental coverage
for their retirees would also probably increase, and
those costs could be passed on to enrollees in the form of
higher premiums. This option would not directly affect
Medicare beneficiaries who receive full Medicaid benefits
or those considered qualified Medicare beneficiaries
because Medicaid would be responsible for the additional
copayments under this option. The savings shown in this
option are net of the additional federal Medicaid spending
that would occur as a result.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that it would discourage
some use of Medicare-covered SNF services that
may have limited value. For those beneficiaries who
would incur higher out-of-pocket costs under this option,
the absence of cost sharing under current law for the first
20 days of SNF care encourages additional use of those
services, some of which may not be clinically necessary.</p>

<p>One argument against this option is that the added
copayment could lead some beneficiaries to forgo services
that would help avoid further complications from surgery
or improve their health in other ways. Some beneficiaries
would probably choose instead to receive similar services
through other benefits in Medicare, such as the home
health care benefit, that currently have no cost sharing
and would not have any cost sharing under this option.
In addition, expenditures for states would rise as a result
of the increase in copayments that Medicaid would cover.</p>
