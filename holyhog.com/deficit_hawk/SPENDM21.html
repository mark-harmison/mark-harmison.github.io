<div><a name="SPENDM21"></a><h1>Reduce Medicare Costs by Changing the Cost-Sharing Structures for Medicare and Medigap Insurance</h1>

<p>In Medicare's traditional fee-for-service program--that is,
services covered under Part A (primarily hospital and
post-acute care) and Part B (physicians' and other outpatient
services)--enrollees' cost sharing varies significantly
depending on the type of service provided. For
example, enrollees must pay a Part A deductible, which
the Congressional Budget Office estimates will be $1,184
in 2013, for each "spell of illness" or injury for which
they are hospitalized; in addition, enrollees are subject to
substantial daily copayments for extended hospital and
skilled nursing care. Meanwhile, the annual deductible
for outpatient services covered under Medicare's Part B is
estimated to be $163 in 2013. Beyond that deductible,
enrollees generally pay 20 percent of allowable costs for
most Part B services, but cost sharing is higher for some
outpatient hospital care. At the same time, certain services
that are covered by Medicare, such as home health
visits and laboratory tests, require no cost sharing at all.
As a result of those variations, enrollees lack consistent
incentives to weigh relative costs when choosing among
options for treatment. Moreover, if Medicare patients
incur extremely high medical costs, they may face a significant
amount of cost sharing because the program does
not place a limit on those expenses.</p>

<p>Because the cost-sharing requirements in Medicare's fee-
for-service program can be substantial, about 90 percent
of enrollees obtain supplemental coverage. About 15 percent
of fee-for-service enrollees have Medicaid coverage as
well, and about 40 percent also have coverage through an
employer. About another 30 percent of fee-for-service
enrollees buy medigap policies--individual insurance
policies that are designed to cover most or all of Medicare's
cost-sharing requirements. Studies have found
that medigap policyholders use about 25 percent more
services than Medicare enrollees who have no supplemental
coverage and about 10 percent more services than
enrollees who have supplemental coverage from a former
employer (which tends to reduce, but not eliminate, their
cost-sharing liabilities). Those differences probably arise
in part because of the incentive effects of cost sharing and
in part because of differences in health status and attitudes
toward health care. Because Medicare enrollees
with supplemental coverage are liable for only a portion
of the costs of those additional services, it is taxpayers
(through Medicare) and not supplemental insurers or the
policyholders themselves who bear most of the resulting
costs. Federal costs for Medicare could be reduced if
medigap plans were restructured so that policyholders
faced some cost sharing for Medicare services but still had
a limit on their out-of-pocket costs.</p>

<p>This option presents three alternatives to reduce Medicare
costs by modifying the cost sharing that Medicare
beneficiaries face. The first alternative would replace
Medicare's current mix of cost-sharing requirements with
a single combined annual deductible of $550 covering all
Part A and Part B services, a uniform coinsurance rate of
20 percent for amounts above that deductible (including
inpatient expenses), and an annual cap of $5,500 on each
enrollee's total cost-sharing liabilities. If this option took
effect on January 1, 2013, and the various thresholds
were indexed to growth in per capita costs for the Medicare
program in later years, federal outlays would be
reduced by about $13 billion over the 2012-2016 period
and by about $32 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>The second alternative would bar medigap policies from
paying any of the first $550 of an enrollee's cost-sharing
liabilities for calendar year 2013 and would limit coverage
to 50 percent of the next $4,950 in Medicare cost sharing.
(All further cost sharing would be covered by the
medigap policy, so enrollees in such policies would not
pay more than about $3,025 in cost sharing in that year.)
If this option took effect on January 1, 2013, and the
various thresholds were indexed as specified in the
first alternative, federal outlays would be reduced by
about $20 billion over the 2012-2016 period and by
roughly $53 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>The third alternative combines the restructuring parameters
for the first two. Therefore, medigap plans would be
prohibited from covering any of the new $550 combined
deductible--which would apply to both Part A and
Part B of Medicare's fee-for-service program. Under this
combined option, the level of beneficiary spending at
which the medigap policy's cap on out-of-pocket costs
was reached would be equal to the level at which the
Medicare program's cap was reached. For spending
between the deductible and the cap on the out-of-pocket
expenditures, medigap policyholders would face a uniform
coinsurance rate of 10 percent for all services;
Medicare beneficiaries without other types of supplemental
coverage would face a uniform coinsurance rate of
20 percent for all services. If this option took effect on
January 1, 2013, and the various thresholds were indexed
to growth in per capita costs for the Medicare program in
later years, federal outlays would be reduced by about
$35 billion over the 2012-2016 period and by roughly
$93 billion over the 2012-2021 period. Those savings do
not equal the sum of the savings that would result from
the first two alternatives because of the interactions
between their effects.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that it would
appreciably strengthen incentives for more prudent use of
medical services--both by raising the initial threshold of
health care costs that most Medicare beneficiaries face
and by ensuring that more enrollees pay at least a portion
of all subsequent costs up to the out-of-pocket limit.
Because medigap plans would be barred from paying the
first $550 of an enrollee's cost-sharing liabilities (under
the second and third alternatives), the costs borne by
medigap plans would decrease, and therefore so would
the premiums that the medigap plans charge. Another
argument in support of this option is that it would provide
greater protection against catastrophic costs. Capping
enrollees' out-of-pocket expenses would especially
help people who develop serious illnesses, require
extended care, or undergo repeated hospitalizations but
lack supplemental coverage for their cost sharing.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that it would boost
cost-sharing liabilities for most Medicare enrollees.
Another argument against the option (specifically, under
the second and third alternatives) is that the restructuring
of medigap coverage would mean that people would not
be able to purchase policies with the low levels of cost
sharing for which they have revealed a preference in the
past. Even with the new cap on out-of-pocket expenses,
some enrollees would object to any policy that denied
them access to full supplemental coverage for their cost
sharing. Furthermore, in any given year, some enrollees
would see their combined payments for premiums and
cost sharing rise.</p>
