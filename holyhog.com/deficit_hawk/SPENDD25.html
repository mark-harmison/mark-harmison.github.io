<div><a name="SPENDD25"></a><h1>Create State Revolving Funds to Finance Rural Water and Waste Disposal</h1>

<p>
The Department of Agriculture assists rural communities
through a program that provides loans, loan guarantees,
and grants for water and waste-disposal projects. It also
offers grants for solid-waste management, emergency
community water assistance, and technical assistance. For
fiscal year 2010, $551 million was appropriated for the
program to fund its grants and cover the cost of its loans
and loan guarantees. (The cost of loans is defined under
the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 as the present
value of interest rate subsidies and expected defaults.)</p>

<p>The program's funds generally are allocated to each state
on the basis of its rural population and the number of
rural families with income below the poverty level. The
Department of Agriculture distributes the funds allocated
to each state on the basis of competitive proposals from
eligible state and local agencies, recognized Native American
tribes, and nonprofit organizations. The terms of
assistance generally depend on the median household
income in a grant recipient's area. Thus, the interest rates
on direct loans for water and waste-disposal projects
range from 60 percent to 100 percent of the market yields
on municipal bonds covering similar numbers of years.
Areas that are particularly needy may apply for grants or
for combinations of grants and loans.</p>

<p>This option would reduce federal spending by providing
an initial infusion of capital for state revolving funds
devoted to rural water and waste disposal and then ending
federal assistance. The revolving funds would be
modeled on those established under amendments to the
Clean Water Act in 1987 and under amendments to the
Safe Drinking Water Act in 1996. The federal savings
would depend on the amount and timing of the contributions
to the revolving funds. Specifically, under this
option, the federal government would provide $550 million
annually for five years and then end assistance beginning
in 2017. The option would save $54 million over
five years and about $2 billion through 2021. (The
details of the option are illustrative; the same basic
approach could be implemented with different capitalization
amounts or periods, yielding different savings.) The
capitalization of the state revolving funds would not by
itself allow states to offer the same amount of assistance
currently provided by the federal grants and loans, but
the Congress could allow the revolving funds to use their
capital as collateral to leverage private-sector financing.</p>

<p>The rationale for this option is that the federal government
should not bear indefinite responsibility for local
development; programs that benefit communities,
whether urban or rural, should be funded by state or local
governments. The rationale for the specific approach in
this option is that it is reasonable to provide funding for a
few years to capitalize revolving funds before they become
self-sustaining.</p>

<p>One argument against this option is that states might
change their aid formulas (substituting loans for grants
or high-interest loans for low-interest loans) to avoid
depleting the funds and to recoup the costs of leveraged
financing. That action could price the aid out of reach of
needier communities.</p>
