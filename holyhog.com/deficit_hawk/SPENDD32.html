<div><a name="SPENDD32"></a><h1>Finance the Food Safety and Inspection Service Through Fees</h1>

<p>The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), an
agency within the Department of Agriculture (USDA),
provides mandatory and continuous inspection services
involving meat, poultry, and processed egg products. The
scope of those services is explicitly defined by the statutes
that give FSIS its inspection authority. Meat inspection is
restricted to species defined as amenable species, such as
cattle, sheep, and swine; catfish were added to that list in
the 2008 farm bill (Public Law 110-246). Poultry and
processed egg products subject to inspection are also
explicitly specified. In addition, FSIS runs a voluntary
inspection service for animals not listed in the statutes for
producers who wish to sell their products in interstate
commerce. Those services are provided on a fee-forservice
basis and are paid by the producers.</p>

<p>FSIS employs about 8,000 full-time in-plant inspectors
and other front-line inspectors who are responsible for
the mandatory inspection of the nation's commercial supply
of meat, poultry, and processed egg products. Meat
and poultry are inspected before they enter or exit the
slaughterhouse and before they are transferred to a processing
facility. Egg processing plants are subject to continuous
inspection whenever the plant is in operation.
Inspectors are also responsible for monitoring adherence
to regulations that govern areas such as sanitary conditions,
recordkeeping, packaging, and ingredient lists. The
majority of those services are funded through annual
appropriations, with the exception of the voluntary
inspection services noted above and inspections performed
during holidays or overtime shifts, which are
funded by user fees. In 2010, FSIS appropriations totaled
approximately $1 billion.</p>

<p>This option would finance all mandatory federal inspections
of meat, poultry, and processed egg products with
fees paid by the processing facilities. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that this option would increase
collections by about $5 billion over 5 years and by
$12 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that users of government
services should pay for them. Federal inspections
benefit producers and consumers of meat, poultry, and
egg products because they prevent diseased animals and
adulterated egg products from being sold for human consumption.
1 The meat and poultry industries also benefit
in other ways. For example, they can advertise that their
products have passed USDA inspection, which some consumers
consider to be an important affirmation of the
safety of the products they purchase.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that the federal government
should protect the public at large through
inspections that ensure the safety of the nation's food supply;
it should therefore be the responsibility of the taxpayers
to pay for those inspections. Another argument
against this option is that the fees imposed on food producers
would probably be passed along to consumers in
the form of higher prices for meat, poultry, and egg
products.</p>
