<div><a name="TAX11"></a><h1>Tax Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits in the Same Way That Distributions from Defined-Benefit Pensions Are Taxed</h1>

<p>Under current law, less than 30 percent of the benefits
paid by the Social Security and Railroad Retirement programs
is subject to the federal income tax. Recipients
with income below a specified threshold pay no taxes on
those benefits. Most recipients fall in that category, which
constitutes the first tier of a three-tiered tax structure. If
the sum of their adjusted gross income, their nontaxable
interest income, and one-half of their Social Security and
Tier I Railroad Retirement benefits exceeds $25,000 (for
single taxpayers) or $32,000 (for couples filing jointly),
up to 50 percent of the benefits are taxed. Above a higher
threshold--$34,000 for single filers and $44,000 for
joint filers--as much as 85 percent of the benefits are
taxed.</p>

<p>By contrast, distributions from defined-benefit plans are
taxable except for the portion that represents the recovery
of an employee's "basis"--that is, his or her after-tax contributions
to the plan. In the year that distributions
begin, the recipient determines the percentage of each
year's payment that is considered to be the nontaxable
recovery of previous after-tax contributions, based on the
cumulative amount of those contributions and projections
of his or her life expectancy. Once the recipient has
recovered his or her entire basis tax-free, all subsequent
pension distributions are fully taxed. (Distributions from
traditional defined-contribution plans and from individual
retirement accounts, to the extent that they are
funded by after-tax contributions, are also taxed on
amounts exceeding the basis.)1</p>

<p>This option would treat the Social Security and Railroad
Retirement programs in the same way that defined-
benefit pensions are treated by defining a basis and
taxing only those benefits that exceed that amount. For
employed individuals, the basis would be the payroll taxes
they paid out of after-tax income to support those programs
(but not the equal amount that employers paid
on their workers' behalf). For self-employed people, the
basis would be the portion (50 percent) of their self-
employment taxes that is not deductible from their taxable
income. Revenues would increase by $184 billion
from 2012 through 2016 and by $438 billion from
2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option concerns equity.
Taxing benefits from the Social Security and Railroad
Retirement programs in the same way as those from
defined-benefit pensions would make the tax system
more equitable in at least two ways. First, it would eliminate
the preferential treatment given to Social Security
benefits but not to pension benefits--a preference that is
minimal for higher-income taxpayers but much larger for
low-and middle-income taxpayers. Second, it would
treat elderly and nonelderly taxpayers with comparable
income the same way. For people who pay taxes on
Social Security benefits under current law, the option
could also simplify the preparation of tax returns because
the Social Security Administration--which would have
information on their lifetime contributions and life
expectancy--could compute the taxable amount of
benefits and provide that information to beneficiaries
each year.</p>

<p>This option also has drawbacks. A greater number of
elderly people would have to file tax returns than do so
now. People with incomes below $44,000, including
some who depend solely on Social Security or Railroad
Retirement for their support, would have their taxes
increased by the greatest percentage. In addition, raising
taxes on Social Security and Railroad Retirement benefits
would be equivalent to reducing those benefits and could
be construed by some retirees--as well as people nearing
retirement--as violating the implicit promises of those
programs, especially because the option would provide no
opportunity for them to adjust their saving or retirement
strategies to mitigate the impact. Finally, calculating the
percentage of each recipient's benefits that would be
excluded from taxation would impose an additional
burden on the Social Security Administration.</p>
