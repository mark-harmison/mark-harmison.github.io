<div><a name="SPENDD2"></a><h1>Cap Increases in Military Basic Pay</h1>

<p>Between 2001 and 2009, per capita spending on three
major components of cash compensation for active military
personnel rose by 37 percent in inflation-adjusted
dollars. Those components are basic pay and the basic
allowances for housing and subsistence, of which basic
pay is the largest element, averaging more than 70 percent
of the total. Lawmakers typically use the percentage
increase in the employment cost index (ECI) for private-
sector workers' wages and salaries as a benchmark for
setting the annual increase in basic pay. In the 1990s, the
military pay raise was generally set equal to the increase
in the ECI or 0.5 percentage points below that amount.
Over the past decade, in each calendar year from
2001 through 2010, lawmakers approved pay raises--
including across-the-board increases and, on occasion,
amounts targeted toward certain seniority levels--that
exceeded the ECI by 0.5 percentage points for the average
service member. Those pay increases boosted outlays not
only in the years in which they took effect but also in
subsequent years as the raises compounded.</p>

<p>Another element of cash compensation is the selective
reenlistment bonus (SRB), an incentive typically offered
to qualified enlisted personnel working in occupational
specialties that have high training costs or demonstrated
shortfalls in retention. Each service branch regularly
adjusts its SRBs to address current retention problems,
adding or dropping eligible specialties and raising or
lowering bonuses. In addition, the Army pays a location-
specific SRB to all eligible soldiers who reenlist while they
are deployed to certain locations, such as Afghanistan,
Iraq, or Kuwait. Depending on the service branch, eligible
personnel either receive the bonuses in a lump sum
when they reenlist or receive half at reenlistment and the
remainder in annual installments over the course of the
additional obligation.</p>

<p>This option would cap the basic pay increase over a four-
year period: Specifically, from 2012 through 2015, basic
pay raises would be set at a rate 0.5 percentage points
below the increase in the ECI. Implementing this option
would require new legislation to override current law,
which stipulates that annual pay raises match the increase
in the ECI. Although the prospect of lower basic pay
raises would probably adversely affect retention, the effect
is likely to be small. To alleviate any effect on retention
during those four years, the service branches could
increase bonuses for enlistment and reenlistment, step up
recruiting efforts, or offer other benefits to service members.
In estimating the budgetary impact of this option,
the Congressional Budget Office assumed that the service
branches would be able to keep overall retention constant
through 2015 by boosting their spending on reenlistment
bonuses while removing current restrictions on the
maximum size of each bonus award.</p>

<p>If implemented, the option would generate net savings of
about $6 billion between 2012 and 2016 and $17 billion
over the 2012-2021 period. Included in those figures are
added costs for bonuses totaling about $920 million
between 2012 and 2015 to offset the effects on retention
of the lower pay raises for service members who had
enlisted or previously reenlisted during the earlier period
when pay was rising at the ECI rate or faster. Service
members eligible for the additional bonuses between
2012 and 2015 would receive higher overall pay than
would be the case had pay kept pace with the ECI. After
the four-year transition period, people would base their
reenlistment decisions on a level of pay that was lower
than would otherwise have prevailed. Although the lower
pay could adversely affect recruiting and retention levels
in future years, based on the success of DoD's personnel
management over the past several years--and the decline
in the number of personnel deployed to Iraq and
Afghanistan--CBO anticipates that DoD would be
able to attain the desired levels in 2016 and beyond
without continuing to pay the additional bonuses.</p>

<p>The rationale for this option is that, although DoD must
offer a competitive compensation package to attract and
retain the military personnel it needs, the annual increase
in the ECI is not an appropriate benchmark for setting
pay raises over the long run. The comparison group for
the ECI includes a broad sample of civilian workers who,
on average, are older than military personnel and more
likely to have college degrees. Those workers have historically
received larger pay increases than the younger workers
who more closely match the demographic profile of
military personnel. According to CBO's analysis, median
cash compensation for military personnel--including the
tax-free cash allowances for food and housing--exceeds
the salaries of most civilians who have comparable education
and work experience.</p>

<p>Another advantage of this option is that, by using SRBs
to direct compensation to service members who are at a
career decision point, as well as to specific occupational
categories that are experiencing shortages, this option
could maintain retention goals at a lower cost than the</p>

<p>current plan that uses across-the-board pay raises to
achieve retention (and other) goals. General pay increases
would alleviate shortages in some occupations but would
worsen surpluses in others. Also, unlike pay increases,
bonuses would be more easily adjusted from year to year
to match recruiting and retention goals. Finally, bonuses
would avoid the added cost of elements of compensation,
such as retirement benefits, that are tied to basic pay.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that expansion of
reenlistment bonuses at the expense of across-the-board
increases in basic pay would amplify pay differences
that exist among occupations and thus counter the military
tradition of paying similar amounts to personnel
with similar levels of responsibility. Capping basic pay
would also reduce other benefits--including retirement
annuities--that service members would receive throughout
their career. Another argument is that the risks service
members may be exposed to when overseas contingency
operations are under way justify the across-the-board pay
increases specified in current law.</p>
