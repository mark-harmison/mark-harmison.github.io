<div><a name="SPENDD5"></a><h1>Increase Cost Sharing for Pharmaceuticals Under TRICARE</h1>

<p>The TRICARE program provides health care for the military's
uniformed personnel and retirees and for their
dependents and survivors. In total, more than 9 million
people are eligible to use TRICARE's integrated system
of military health care facilities and regional networks of
civilian providers under contract to the Department of
Defense (DoD). Beneficiaries may take their prescriptions
to military pharmacies, which fill prescriptions
written by any qualified provider, whether military or
civilian, in or outside of TRICARE's network. Beneficiaries
who prefer not to use military pharmacies may take
prescriptions to retail pharmacies in the TRICARE network
or use TRICARE's mail-order pharmacy. In 2009,
DoD spent more than $8 billion on outpatient pharmacy
benefits.</p>

<p>Cost sharing for pharmaceuticals--in the form of a
copayment for each prescription filled--varies not only
by the type of drug but also by where the prescription is
filled. Beneficiaries pay nothing for prescriptions filled at
military pharmacies, although those facilities tend to be
located on military bases and may be less convenient than
a retail pharmacy for some beneficiaries. Military pharmacies
carry only generic drugs and brand-name drugs in
the TRICARE formulary (the list of drugs that the plan
covers). Beneficiaries who fill their prescriptions at retail
pharmacies pay $3 for a 30-day supply of generic drugs,
$9 for the same supply of brand-name drugs in the
TRICARE formulary, and $22 if the drug is not listed in
the formulary. Alternatively, they may order a 90-day
supply by mail; copayments for mail-order prescriptions
are also $3, $9, or $22 for generic, formulary, or non-
formulary drugs, respectively, but the beneficiary receives
a 90-day supply for that copayment, compared with a 30day
supply from retail pharmacies. Finally, beneficiaries
who choose to fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies that
are not part of the TRICARE network must meet a
deductible (which varies by military rank) and bear
greater cost sharing than beneficiaries who choose other
alternatives.</p>

<p>This option would raise the copayments for pharmaceuticals
under the TRICARE plan. Active-duty service
members would continue to receive their prescriptions at
no cost from those pharmacies, but all other beneficiaries
would pay $3 for generics and $9 for brand-name pharmaceuticals
on the TRICARE formulary when purchasing
the drugs from military pharmacies. Prescriptions
filled at participating network retailers would cost the
beneficiaries $15, $25, or $45 for a 30-day supply of
generic, formulary, or nonformulary pharmaceuticals,
respectively. Prescriptions filled by mail order would cost
$9, $27, or $45 for a 90-day supply of generic, formulary,
or nonformulary pharmaceuticals, respectively.</p>

<p>The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this
option would save about $10 billion over the period from
2012 to 2016 and about $26 billion over the next
10 years, relative to CBO's baseline projections. (Total
savings would be greater, but some are already incorporated
in the baseline. See the note to the above table.)
About half of the savings would be attributed to pharmacy
spending by beneficiaries eligible for Medicare and
would be classified as mandatory. The other half of the
savings would be subject to annual appropriation acts.
DoD's outlays would be reduced, in part, because the
increased cost-sharing payments would directly offset
some of the government's cost for the pharmaceuticals.
In addition, the higher copayments would induce some
people who otherwise would have used the TRICARE
program to rely instead on a civilian pharmacy benefit--
one available through their spouse's employment, for
example.</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that larger copayments
would foster more disciplined use of medical resources
and discourage low-value treatments. In an era of fiscal
constraint, rapidly rising health care costs may result in
fewer resources available for DoD to purchase and
maintain weapon systems and other equipment. This
option would begin to curtail the growth in health care
costs, freeing those resources for other defense priorities.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that the larger copayments
might impose a financial strain on some beneficiaries,
who might terminate their use of the TRICARE
pharmacy benefit and risk harming their health. The
health of people who continue to use the TRICARE benefit,
moreover, might suffer if they are discouraged from
treating their illnesses with pharmaceuticals in a timely
manner or from completing a drug treatment regimen in
the face of higher copayments.</p>
