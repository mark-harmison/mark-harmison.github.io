<div><a name="SPENDD9"></a><h1>Cut the Number of Aircraft Carriers to 10 and the Number of Navy Air Wings to 9</h1>

<p>The Administration's 2011 budget called for maintaining
a fleet of 11 aircraft carriers and 10 active-duty naval air
wings. For the 2013-2015 period, the number of carriers
will temporarily fall to 10 as a result of the three-year gap
between the decommissioning of the USS Enterprise in
early 2013 and the commissioning of its replacement, the
USS Gerald R. Ford, in late 2015. (The number of active
air wings is one less than the number of carriers because,
at any particular time, one of the Navy's carriers is usually
undergoing a major overhaul.) Aircraft carriers are also
accompanied by a mix of surface combatants (usually
cruisers and destroyers) and submarines to defend against
aircraft, ships, and submarines that might threaten the
carrier. The Navy calls such a force a carrier strike group.</p>

<p>This option would permanently reduce the carrier force
to 10 and the number of air wings to 9. It would do so
primarily by retiring a Nimitz class carrier, the USS
George Washington, in 2016, when it is scheduled to
undergo various maintenance activities and have its
nuclear reactors refueled, an expensive and time-
consuming process. Those changes would save the refueling
and overhaul costs that the Navy expects to incur
between 2012 and 2017 (the Navy begins purchasing
long-lead items several years before the refueling is scheduled),
as well as the operating costs associated with the
ship between 2017 and 2021 and thereafter. Overall, this
option would save about $620 million in outlays over the
2012-2016 period and about $7 billion over the 2012-
2021 period.</p>

<p>The savings in this option reflect the assumption that the
Navy would permanently reduce the size of its force by
5,600 sailors after the George Washington is decommissioned
in 2016. Those savings would be partially offset,
however, by the cost of decommissioning a Nimitz class
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which involves removing
the two nuclear reactor plants from the ship and placing
them at a permanent storage site, as well as dismantling
the ship. Decommissioning a Nimitz class carrier would
eventually cost a total of about $2 billion, although only
about $1 billion would be spent through 2021.</p>

<p>Under this option, the other ships associated with a carrier
strike group would be retained and deployed to support
other Navy missions, so no additional savings related
to other types of ships would be realized from the decommissioning.
In addition, although the administrative
structure of the retired air wing would be eliminated, the
aircraft would be retained to reduce the shortfall between
the Navy's goals and the number of planes in its inventory.
About 8 percent of the savings from this option
would come from smaller accrual payments to the military
retirement and health care trust funds as a result of
the reduction in Navy personnel associated with removing
the ship from the fleet. Although those accrual payments
are intragovernmental transfers that would not
represent current savings to the federal government, they
are shown in the budget as savings to the Department of
the Navy and represent long-term savings to the federal
government as a whole.</p>

<p>The rationale for this option is that the Navy could carry
out its mission with fewer aircraft carriers. Recent experience
suggests that the Navy mobilizes 5 to 7 carriers to
fight a major war, and the 10 carriers remaining in the
fleet under this option would still provide a force of at
least 5 or 6 carriers within 90 days to fight such a war. In
addition, although the Navy would lose some ability to
provide a carrier presence overseas, 10 carriers would be
enough to provide full-time coverage in the western
Pacific and the Arabian Sea, as well as coverage in the
Mediterranean Sea for two or three months of the year.
Some analysts have argued that because the Mediterranean
region is more secure than it was during the Cold
War, it no longer requires the continuous or nearly
continuous presence of an aircraft carrier. Should the
need for a carrier arise in the Mediterranean, the one in
the Arabian Sea could be sent there quickly via the Suez
Canal, or a carrier could depart from Norfolk and arrive
near Europe within 35 days.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that having one less
aircraft carrier increases the operational risk the Navy is
taking because that carrier could be valuable in the event
of a major conflict--in part because it has the flexibility
to operate anywhere in the world without the permission
of another country. Further, the U.S. military's European,</p>

<p>Central (Middle East), and Pacific Commands each have
goals for full-time carrier presence in their respective
regions. Under current crewing and operating practices,
15 carriers would be needed to achieve that presence, and
having one less carrier would move even farther away
from that goal. In addition, the two wars since 1990 in
the Mediterranean area (Bosnia and Kosovo) that
involved the support of carrier strike groups, and the
political unrest in that area, may indicate that having a
carrier presence there would be particularly valuable.</p>
