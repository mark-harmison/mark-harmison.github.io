<div><a name="SPENDD16"></a><h1>Reduce Department of Energy Funding for Energy Technology Development</h1>

<p>Since 1978, the Department of Energy (DOE) has spent
more than $45 billion to develop new technologies in the
areas of fossil fuels, nuclear power, and energy efficiency
and renewable energy (EERE). Currently, a variety of
DOE programs support research and development
(R&D) of those energy technologies and their commercial
demonstration. Spending for such efforts peaked in
the 1980s and declined during the following 20 years,
but funding began to increase again in 2006. Many lawmakers
have questioned the value of those technology
development programs and have considered whether
DOE should cut back on programs to develop near-term
energy technologies and concentrate instead on basic
research in those fields.</p>

<p>This option would reduce spending for technology development
in the fossil, nuclear, and EERE R&D programs
to 25 percent of their 2011 levels. The Congressional
Budget Office estimates that, in total, those reductions
would reduce discretionary outlays by about $4 billion
over the 2012-2016 period and by about $11 billion over
10 years. The specific activities that would be eliminated
in those programs are those that focus on the later stages
of technology development, the demonstration of commercial
feasibility, and the deployment of new technologies.
(This option would not affect funds for technical
assistance and financial assistance, such as weatherization
services for low-income families. See Discretionary
Spending--Option 15.)</p>

<p>An argument for this option is that some of DOE's activities
are better undertaken by the private sector, which
has an advantage in the development, demonstration,
and deployment of new energy technologies. Generally,
the direct feedback that the markets provide to private
investors has proved more cost-effective than the judgment
of government managers in selecting which technologies
will be successful in the market. The limits on
the government's ability to foster new energy technologies
are illustrated by DOE's Partnership for a New Generation
of Vehicles (PNGV). The original goal of PNGV
research was a production-ready vehicle powered by a
hybrid (diesel and electric) motor for U.S. automakers.
in a small-sized car, were ultimately the first to supply--
and subsequently dominate--the U.S. market for small
hybrid cars. Similarly, in the area of fossil energy development,
DOE has long sought to introduce new energy
technologies through expensive technology demonstration
plants that have often failed to deliver commercially
useful knowledge. Accordingly, proponents of this option
would scale back DOE's efforts to support applied
research and the commercialization of new technologies
and shift resources to favor DOE's support of basic and
early applied research, which is less likely to be undertaken
by the private sector.</p>

<p>Another argument for this option is that federal agencies
have too many conflicting policy goals to implement a
program of investments efficiently, as would be required
for large technology demonstration projects. The
Government Accountability Office (GAO) has long
been critical of DOE's project management, pointing to
inadequate oversight of contractors and to projects that
failed to meet expectations for costs or schedules. Despite
DOE's attempts at reform, GAO concluded in 2007 that
DOE's performance had not improved substantially
because new management processes had not been applied
consistently.</p>

<p>Other arguments focus on the merits of specific programs.
Regarding R&D related to nuclear energy in
particular, some observers question the wisdom of pursuing
new technologies as long as electric utilities--the
intended recipients--are not building new nuclear
plants. Since many state policymakers moved to
deregulate the electricity-generation market in the 1990s,
investors have generally shied away from building capital-
intensive generating facilities, preferring to rely on less
expensive natural gas facilities instead. Recent developments
suggest that the natural gas required to power
those new generators will remain cheap and plentiful for
the foreseeable future, casting further doubt on the financial
viability of nuclear-powered generators.</p>

<p>In the EERE area, which includes energy conservation as
well as solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources,
the federal government provides support through other
means. Many of the technologies whose development is
supported by the EERE programs also receive the tax
credit for renewable electricity production or conservation-
related tax credits. Furthermore, several of the EERE
industries enjoy high rates of growth. Given the tax preferences
and the high level of market penetration, some
analysts argue that it may be time to begin withdrawing
federal commitments for further technology development
in those areas.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that federal support
may be needed because the prices businesses and consumers
pay for energy do not compensate for the potentially
large long-run costs of climate change. Reducing emissions
of greenhouse gases would diminish those costs, but
because those costs are not reflected in current energy
prices, producers and consumers have little incentive to
manufacture or purchase products that reduce energy
consumption or produce energy with minimal greenhouse
gas emissions. Thus, some observers argue that
DOE's energy technology development programs fill a
gap left by the market by providing the resources and
incentives necessary to develop new technologies to
produce and conserve energy.</p>

<p>In addition, most analysts agree that investors in many
sectors, not just energy, do not receive all the benefits of
investment in R&D because others also benefit from the
knowledge gained. That result suggests a possible need
for federal support to ensure that adequate R&D takes
place. Because society gains even if the original investor
does not capture all the benefits, it is argued, the federal
government should invest in R&D to compensate for the
gap between all the benefits that accrue to society and
those that the original investors receive.</p>

<p>Finally, some analysts assert that DOE's technology
development programs are a worthwhile activity on their
own merits. Panels convened by the National Academy of
Sciences have estimated that some of DOE's technology
development programs, especially in the area of energy
efficiency, have provided substantial benefits that exceed
their costs.</p>
