<div><a name="SPENDD34"></a><h1>Increase Payments by Tenants in Federally Assisted Housing</h1>

<p>Most low-income tenants who qualify for federal rental
assistance receive aid through the Housing Choice
Voucher Program (sometimes called Section 8), the
Public Housing Program, or project-based assistance programs
(which designate privately owned, government-
subsidized units for low-income tenants). Funded by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), those programs usually require that tenants pay
30 percent of their gross monthly household income
(after certain adjustments) for rent; the federal government
subsidizes the difference between that amount and
the maximum allowable rent. In 2010, the Congressional
Budget Office estimates, the average combined federal
expenditure for all of HUD's rental housing assistance
programs was roughly $7,500 per household. That
amount includes the housing subsidies and fees paid to
the agencies that administer the programs.</p>

<p>This option would gradually increase tenants' rental
contributions from 30 percent of adjusted gross family
income to 35 percent over the 2012-2016 period.
Provided that federal appropriations were reduced
accordingly, those higher rent contributions would
reduce outlays by a total of about $8 billion over 5 years:
about $4 billion for the Housing Choice Voucher Program,
almost $2 billion for the Public Housing Program,
and about $2 billion for project-based assistance
programs. Savings would total about $25 billion over
10 years.</p>

<p>An argument in support of this option is that, on
average, renters not currently receiving vouchers or rent
subsidies--"unassisted" renters--whose income is comparable
with that of assisted renters spend roughly 40 percent
of their income on rent. Even if the contribution
requirement for subsidized renters increased to 35 percent
of family income, that contribution would still be
below the amount that unassisted renters currently spend
on rent. Furthermore, households that received assistance
would continue to benefit from paying a fixed percentage
of their income toward housing, whereas unassisted renters
with similar family income could confront increases in
housing costs relative to their income.</p>

<p>An argument against implementing this option is that
housing costs for most renters who currently receive assistance
would rise, and even a modest increase in rent
could be difficult to manage for households with very low
income. In addition, by increasing the proportion of
income that tenants are required to pay in rent, the
option would reduce some participants' incentive to
increase their income by working more.</p>
