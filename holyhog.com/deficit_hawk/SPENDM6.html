<div><a name="SPENDM6"></a><h1>Reduce the Premium Subsidy in the Crop Insurance Program</h1>

<p>The Federal Crop Insurance Program protects farmers
from losses caused by drought, floods, pest infestation,
other natural disasters, and low market prices. Farmers
can choose various amounts and types of insurance
protection--for example, they can insure against losses
caused by poor crop yields, low crop prices, or both.
Premium rates for federal crop insurance are set by the
Department of Agriculture (USDA) so that the premium
equals the expected payment to farmers for crop losses.
The federal government pays about 60 percent and
farmers pay about 40 percent of the total premium.
Insurance policies purchased through the program are
sold and serviced by private insurance companies, which
receive a federal reimbursement for their administrative
costs. Those businesses also share in insurance gains and
losses through reinsurance agreements with the federal
government.</p>

<p>This option would reduce the federal government's subsidy
to 50 percent of the crop insurance premium. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that under current
law, federal spending for crop insurance will total $35 billion
over the 2012-2016 period; reducing the crop insurance
premium subsidy would save more than $5 billion
over the same period and almost $12 billion over the
2012-2021 period, CBO estimates.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that lawmakers
could probably cut the premium subsidy without substantially
affecting the level of participation in the program,
partly because of linkages between crop insurance
and other assistance programs offered by USDA and
partly because private lenders increasingly view insurance
as a way for farmers to ensure that they can repay their
loans. Those producers who did reduce their crop insurance
coverage or dropped out of the program would continue
to receive substantial crop and income support
from other federal farm programs.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that federal funding
for the program has already been reduced by about
5 percent through changes in the 2008 farm bill and by
an additional estimated 5 percent through changes in the
reinsurance agreements with private companies in 2010.
Further cuts, some argue, would threaten farmers' access
to insurance. If participation in the crop insurance program
declines significantly, opponents say, lawmakers
would be more likely to resort to special-purpose relief
programs when disaster strikes, reducing the savings from
cutting the premium subsidy. (Such ad hoc disaster assistance
programs for farmers have cost an average of about
$700 million annually over the past five years.)</p>
