<div><a name="SPENDD10"></a><h1>Cancel the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle</h1>

<p>The Marine Corps' expeditionary fighting vehicle (EFV)
is a tracked armored vehicle that can travel at high speed
through the water from a ship to land. The Marine Corps
regards the EFV as essential for the conduct of amphibious
warfare in the future, particularly for its concept of
operational maneuver from the sea, in which troops
deploy from ships and move directly to their intended
objective far inland without pausing to build up additional
forces on the beach. In a major amphibious assault
from the sea, six brigades of Marines would deploy from
amphibious ships to attack the enemy position. Four of
those brigades would be equipped with EFVs, and the
other two brigades would deploy from aircraft. According
to the Marine Corps, the EFV represents a significant
improvement over the existing amphibious assault vehicles
(AAVs). The EFV is more survivable and can deploy
with higher speed and from much greater distances than
the AAVs. In particular, the EFV is intended to deploy
from amphibious ships that are 25 nautical miles from
the shore compared with only a few miles for the AAV.
The higher speed and range provide the Marines with
more flexibility as to where and when they land, making
it more difficult for the enemy to defend against the
assault.</p>

<p>The Marine Corps plans to begin procuring the EFV in
2012. Annual procurement costs would range from about
$500 million to $1 billion between 2013 and 2025, when
the program would end. The entire program would
involve 574 EFVs at a total procurement cost of about
$12 billion. The Marine Corps has already spent about
$3 billion to develop the vehicle.</p>

<p>This option would cancel the program but provide a
stream of research and development funds--and, eventually,
procurement funds--that would enable the Marine
Corps to come up with an alternative to the EFV. This
option does not specify which alternative the Marine
Corps would pursue in lieu of the EFV but simply
reserves research, development, and procurement funding
for an alternative. Such an alternative could involve a different
tracked amphibious vehicle that "swims" ashore
but is better suited for ground combat, for example, or a
new ground combat vehicle that is ferried to shore by a
high-speed, ship-to-shore connector craft. Savings over
the 2012-2016 period would total about $2 billion. Savings
over a longer period would depend on which alternative
system emerged from research and development.</p>

<p>An argument for this option is that when the EFV was
first conceived as a replacement for the AAV two decades
ago, the prospective combat environment was very different.
At that time it was thought that the proliferation of
antiship cruise missiles would compel naval forces to
operate 25 nautical miles from the shore; an amphibious
vehicle would therefore need high speed and greater range
to deploy from its ship. However, many supporters of this
option observe that over the past 20 years the shore-based
threats to naval forces have grown more diversified,
sophisticated, and numerous; as a result, naval forces in
the future may have to operate much farther than 25 nautical
miles from an enemy shore to be able to protect
themselves from antiship threats. In addition, new enemy
tactics and threats have emerged from the insurgency
campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan that make the EFV
particularly vulnerable during operations on land. To
achieve high speed in getting ashore, the EFV is designed
with a flat bottom. Once ashore, however, that flat-
bottom design, as well as other features of the EFV--its
flat sides, low ground clearance, light armor, small interior
space, and many hydraulic pressure lines throughout
the inside--make the vehicle particularly vulnerable to
tactics that employ improvised explosive devices (IEDs),
mines, and antiarmor weapons. In short, optimizing the
vehicle to get to shore quickly makes it much more vulnerable
in a fight once it has reached land. Supporters of
this option also argue that if the objective is to use the
EFV's range to land in places that are not heavily
defended, speed may be less important than the ability to
engage in effective ground combat once the force has
landed. In addition, the growing cost of the program
could make it difficult for the Marine Corps to buy other
needed ground equipment.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that the major criticisms
of the EFV's capabilities are overstated and that
canceling the EFV is tantamount to abandoning the concept
of major amphibious warfare. Under that argument,
what is needed is an amphibious vehicle with the capability
to get to shore quickly and then immediately move
out and fight. Canceling the EFV now would at best
mean relying on the aging AAV for years to come. Redesigning
the EFV to make it less vulnerable to IEDs or
mines would mean forgoing the flat bottom of the vehicle
needed to achieve the high speed from the ship to shore.
A better solution to the vehicle's vulnerabilities, supporters
of the EFV argue, would be to use more blast-resistant
material in constructing the vehicle and to employ bolt-
on armor when needed. Furthermore, the threat of IEDs
and mines would be mitigated by the range of the EFV,
which makes it difficult for the enemy to predict where
the vehicle would land and therefore where to place IEDs
and mines.</p>
