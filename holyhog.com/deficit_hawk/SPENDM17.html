<p>Under Medicare's prospective payment system for
inpatient medical services, hospitals with teaching programs
receive additional funds for costs related to graduate
medical education (GME). One component of that
additional funding, direct graduate medical education
(DGME), covers a portion of a teaching hospital's costs
for compensation of physicians serving as medical residents
and for institutional overhead. DGME payments
are based on a hospital's 1984 costs per resident (indexed
for changes in consumer prices), the number of residents,
and Medicare's share of total inpatient days at that hospital.
The other component, indirect medical education
(IME), is intended to cover teaching-related costs that are
not attributable either to residents' compensation or to
other direct costs of running a residency program. Examples
of IME costs are the added demands placed on staff
as a result of teaching activities and the greater number of
tests and procedures ordered by residents as part of the
learning and teaching process. Teaching hospitals also
tend to treat a larger proportion of severely ill patients,
which raises costs. Under current law, for every increase
of 0.1 in the ratio of full-time residents to the number of
beds, the IME adjustment provides teaching hospitals
with about 5.5 percent more in payments. However, the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) has
consistently found that the IME calculation overstates the
effect of teaching status on incurred costs. In its most
recent (March 2010) report to the Congress on Medicare's
payment policy, MedPAC estimates that an IME
adjustment of about 2 percent more closely reflects the
indirect costs that teaching hospitals actually incur.</p>

<p>Teaching hospitals also receive GME payments from both
the federal government and the states through the Medicaid
program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates
that total mandatory federal spending for hospital-based
GME in 2010 was about $10 billion--$9.5 billion
through Medicare and $500 million through Medicaid.</p>

<p>This option would consolidate all mandatory federal
spending for GME into a grant program for teaching
hospitals. Total funds available for distribution would be
based on the 2011 aggregate payments for DGME and
Medicaid GME plus the 2011 aggregate payments for
IME reduced to reflect a 2.2 percent IME adjustment.
Total funding for the grant program would grow with
inflation as measured by the consumer price index for all
urban consumers minus 1 percentage point per year. Payments
would be apportioned according to the number of
residents at a hospital and the portion of the hospital's
inpatient days accounted for by Medicare and Medicaid
patients.</p>

<p>In CBO's estimation, this option would save approximately
$25 billion over the 2012-2016 period and
roughly $69 billion over the 2012-2021 period. By
2021, the annual savings would represent about
60 percent of federal spending for GME projected
under current law.</p>

<p>If the discretionary funds for graduate medical training
currently provided by the Health Resources and Services
Administration of the Department of Health and Human
Services were also included in the mandatory grant
pool, total available funding would rise by an estimated
$300 million in 2013. If that component of the funding
was also automatically indexed to inflation (instead of
remaining subject to annual appropriations), the option
would decrease mandatory spending by about $66 billion
over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>An argument for reducing the subsidy for GME is that
federal payments under current law exceed hospitals'
actual teaching costs. As MedPAC's analysis suggests, a
smaller subsidy would create savings for the federal budget
without unduly affecting hospitals' teaching activities.
A smaller subsidy would also remove an incentive for hospitals
to have a greater number of residents than may be
necessary. If hospitals responded to the reduction in the
subsidy by lowering residents' compensation, residents
would bear more of the cost of their medical training,
which might deter some people from entering the medical
profession. However, medical training enables individuals
to earn a significantly higher income in the
future, and market incentives appear to be sufficient to
encourage people to become physicians.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that reducing the federal
subsidy for GME could lead some teaching hospitals
to train fewer residents or devote less time and fewer
resources to beneficial educational activities. Also, to the</p>

<p>extent that some teaching hospitals use a portion of their
additional payments to fund care for uninsured individuals,
decreasing those payments could reduce the number
of patients that hospitals treat or lower the quality of care
that those hospitals provide. Another argument against
the option is that states could lose some discretion to
direct Medicaid GME payments to hospitals because the
federal government would be administering the grant
program. Finally, even if payments were initially equal to
hospitals' costs, the payments would grow more slowly
than inflation and thus might not keep pace with
increases in costs.</p>
