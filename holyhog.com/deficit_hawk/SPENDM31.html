<div><a name="SPENDM31"></a><h1>Lengthen by Three Years the Computation Period for Social Security Benefits</h1>

<p>As required by law, the Social Security Administration
calculates retirement benefits on the basis of a worker's
wage history, using the worker's average indexed monthly
earnings, or AIME. The current formula computes the
AIME on the basis of a worker's earnings in his or her
35 years of highest earnings that are subject to Social
Security taxes. If a worker has worked for fewer than
35 years, the average includes years with zero earnings.</p>

<p>This option would gradually lengthen the AIME computation
period to 38 years for people who turn 62 in 2014
and beyond. The extended averaging period would generally
reduce benefits by requiring that additional years of
lower earnings be factored into the benefit computation.
The option would not change the number of years used
to compute AIMEs for disabled workers; only retirement
benefits would be affected.</p>

<p>The option would have the largest effect on people who
worked for fewer than 38 years, because they would have
additional years with no earnings included in the calculation
of their benefits. However, the option would reduce
benefits even for workers who worked 38 years or more,
because those people would almost always have had lower
average earnings in the additional computation years than
they would have had in the 35 years of their highest
earnings.</p>

<p>Lengthening the period by three years would reduce federal
outlays by almost $7 billion through 2016 and by
roughly $51 billion through 2021. By 2050, Social Security
outlays would be reduced by 2 percent--from
5.9 percent to 5.8 percent of gross domestic product.</p>

<p>An argument in support of expanding the computation
period considers increased life expectancy: Because people
now live longer, lengthening the period would
encourage them to remain in the labor force longer and
extend the amount of time they pay into the Social Security
system, boosting federal revenues from income and
payroll taxes. Additional work would also result in higher
future Social Security benefits. The 10-year estimates for
this option do not include those two effects.</p>

<p>Extending the computation period also would reduce the
advantage currently enjoyed by workers who postpone
entering the labor force--for instance, while they pursue
advanced education. People with more education generally
earn more than their counterparts who enter the
labor force sooner; because many years of low or no earnings
can now be ignored in calculating the AIME, the
former group experiences little or no loss of benefits for
any additional years spent not working and thus not paying
Social Security taxes.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that some beneficiaries
retire early because of circumstances they do not control,
such as poor health or job loss, and this option could
adversely affect those recipients who were not able to continue
working for 38 years. Other disproportionately
affected workers would be parents who interrupted a
career to raise children or workers who experienced long
stretches of unemployment. On average, the benefit
reduction would be larger for women than for men,
because women tend to spend more years out of the
workforce.</p>
