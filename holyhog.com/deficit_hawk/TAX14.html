<div><a name="TAX14"></a><h1>Modify or Eliminate the Child Tax Credit</h1>

<p>The child tax credit, first enacted in the Taxpayer Relief
Act of 1997, allows taxpayers to claim a credit against
their federal income tax liability for each eligible child. To
qualify, the child must be 16 or younger at the close of
the tax year, and the taxpayer must be able to claim the
child as a dependent. The credit phases out for single
filers whose adjusted gross income is more than $75,000
and for joint filers whose income is above $110,000. The
Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 (EGTRRA) and other laws increased the credit
from $500 to $1,000 per child. Most recently, the Tax
Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and
Job Creation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-312, referred
to in this report as the 2010 tax act) extended the $1,000
per child credit through 2012. Starting in 2013, however,
the credit amount will return to its pre-EGTRRA
amount of $500 per child.</p>

<p>The child tax credit is partially refundable, which means
that families whose income tax liability (before the credit
is applied) is less than the total amount of the credit may
receive all or at least a portion of the credit as a payment.
Before 2001, only taxpayers with three or more children
were eligible for a refundable child tax credit, and the
refund was limited to the amount by which their Social
Security taxes exceeded the earned income tax credit, or
EITC. (The earned income tax credit is a fully refundable
credit designed to supplement the wages of low-income
families.) EGTRRA made the credit refundable for taxpayers
with one or two children and also introduced a
new formula for computing the refund. Under the new
formula, the refund could not exceed 15 percent of the
taxpayer's earned income above an established threshold.
That threshold was initially set at $10,000 in 2001 and
indexed for inflation; but it has been temporarily reduced
to $3,000 by legislation several times over the past few
years. Although smaller families must use the newer
method to calculate the refundable credit, taxpayers with
three or more children can choose the method that yields
the larger refund. Beginning in 2013, with the expiration
of the 2010 tax act, the criteria for receiving refunds will
revert to those in effect before 2001: Only taxpayers with
three or more children will be eligible for a refund, which
in turn, will be limited to the amount that taxpayers'
Social Security taxes exceed their EITC.</p>

<p>Starting in 2013, the first variant of this option would
eliminate the portion of the child tax credit that is
refundable. The second variant would eliminate the child
tax credit altogether. The first approach would reduce the
deficit by $11 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by
$27 billion over the 10-year projection period; the second
would reduce the deficit by $48 billion from 2012
through 2016 and by $117 billion from 2012 through
2021.</p>

<p>One argument for curtailing or eliminating the child tax
credit is that other features of the individual income
tax--such as the standard deduction for heads of households,
personal exemptions, the dependent care tax
credit, and the EITC--already provide significant tax
preferences to families with children. (For example, a
typical single parent with two children is projected to
receive up to nearly $5,300 from the EITC in 2013.)</p>

<p>Moreover, the credit does not benefit many of the poorest
families because they have no income tax liability--when
the credit reverts to its pre-EGTRRA form in 2013,
only a handful of taxpayers with three or more children
will be eligible for a refundable credit. (Even under the
provisions of law that will be in place in 2012--specifically,
as outlined by the 2010 tax act--a household's
earnings will have to exceed a minimum threshold to be
eligible for the refundable credit.) Another argument for
the option is that having children represents a family's
decision about how to spend its income--a choice that
could be considered analogous to other decisions about
spending.</p>

<p>Either alternative would also simplify the tax code. The
phaseout of the child tax credit at higher income levels
requires taxpayers to complete a separate worksheet and
perform additional computations. The computation of
the refundable portion of the credit for families with
three or more children is particularly complex. If policy-
makers believe that some families do not receive sufficient
assistance through the tax system, then a simpler way to
provide benefits would be through expansions of the
other child-related tax benefits.</p>

<p>An argument against reducing or eliminating the child
tax credit is that the other preferences in the tax code may
not fully compensate families for the extra costs of raising
children. And eliminating the portion of the tax credit
that is refundable, in particular, would limit compensation
to those families least able to bear those additional
costs. Raising children is an investment that may benefit
all of society when those children become productive
adults. With additional resources, parents could invest
more in child rearing and benefit society as a whole.
Those social benefits could take many forms, such as a
better educated and more productive workforce, a healthier
population, or a more civically engaged electorate.</p>
