<div><a name="SPENDM20"></a><h1>Require a Copayment for Home Health Episodes Covered by Medicare</h1>

<p>The Congressional Budget Office projects that the use of
home health services, and the resulting costs to the Medicare
program, will grow rapidly over the next 10 years,
rising from about $23 billion in 2012 to $52 billion in
2021. One reason for the high level of spending is that
Medicare beneficiaries are not required to pay any of the
costs of home health services covered by the program.</p>

<p>This option would charge Medicare beneficiaries a copayment
amounting to 10 percent of the total cost of each
home health episode--a 60-day period of services--
starting on January 1, 2013. That change would yield net
federal savings of $14 billion over the 2012-2016 period
and $40 billion over the 2012-2021 period. For Medicare
beneficiaries who use home health services, the average
increase in Medicare copayments in 2013 would be
about $600.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that it would
directly offset a portion of Medicare's home health outlays
and encourage some beneficiaries to use those services
in a cost-conscious manner. The use of services
would also decrease, most likely among the approximately
10 percent of beneficiaries with fee-for-service
Medicare only--that is, beneficiaries who do not have
supplemental insurance, such as medigap or "wraparound"
retiree coverage, and who are not enrolled in
Medicaid or a health maintenance organization.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that it would increase
the risk of significant out-of-pocket costs for the 10 percent
of Medicare enrollees who have fee-for-service coverage
only--a population that tends to have lower income
than do beneficiaries with private supplemental insurance.
As a result, implementing the option could cause
some of those individuals to forgo beneficial care. Among
the majority of enrollees who have supplemental insurance,
little or no drop in use would be expected because
their supplemental policies would presumably be
expanded to cover the home health copayment proposed
in this option. For that reason, the approximately 25 percent
of enrollees with individually purchased medigap
policies would probably face higher premiums, and the
costs of employment-based supplemental policies could
also rise. Finally, this option would result in increased
spending by Medicaid for home health care for individuals
who have both Medicare and Medicaid coverage; the
federal share of higher Medicaid outlays is included in the
estimated change in outlays.</p>
