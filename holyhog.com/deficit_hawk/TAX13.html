<div><a name="TAX13"></a><h1>Replace the Tax Exclusion for Interest Income on State and Local Bonds with a Direct Subsidy for the Issuer</h1>

<p>The federal tax code offers several types of tax preferences
for bonds issued by state and local governments. First,
interest income from governmental bonds--those that
state and local governments issue to finance their own
activities--can be excluded from a bondholder's adjusted
gross income (AGI). As a result, the interest earned
on those bonds is exempt from the federal income tax.
Second, the interest earned on qualified private activity
bonds--which states and localities can issue to finance
certain types of socially beneficial projects undertaken by
private entities, such as the construction of hospitals and
schools--can also be excluded from a bondholder's AGI.
(In some cases, however, that income may be subject to
the alternative minimum tax.) As a result of those tax
preferences, borrowers pay less interest than they would
on comparable bonds with taxable interest. The revenue
forgone by the federal government effectively pays part of
the borrowing costs of state and local governments and
of those private entities whose bonds qualify for a tax
preference.</p>

<p>For governmental and qualified private activity bonds
issued in 2012 and afterward, this option would replace
the exclusion for interest income with a subsidy paid
directly to the issuers of the bonds. Under the option,
borrowers would make taxable interest payments to
bondholders; in turn, state and local issuers of those
bonds would receive a subsidy payment directly from the
federal government equal to 15 percent of the interest
paid on the bonds. (States and localities that issued
qualified private activity bonds would pass the subsidy
payment on to the corresponding borrower in the private
sector.) The option would retain restrictions that apply to
governmental bonds, such as those on arbitrage earnings.
In addition, it would not alter any of the limits--such
as volume caps--currently imposed on the issuance of
qualified private activity bonds. If implemented, such a
policy change would increase federal revenues by more
than it would increase federal outlays, for a net saving of
$31 billion from 2012 through 2016 and of $143 billion
from 2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>Making subsidy payments to borrowers for the bond
interest they pay could have several advantages. First,
switching from a tax exclusion to a subsidy payment for
bond interest would be a more cost-effective way of
providing a subsidy to borrowers. Only a portion of the
federal revenue currently forgone through a tax exclusion
on bond interest income actually lowers financing costs;
in contrast, borrowers would receive all of the benefits
of direct subsidy payments for bond interest. The tax
exclusion on interest income is less cost-effective because
some of the federal revenue forgone through the tax
exclusion goes to bondholders in higher tax brackets.
They receive gains that exceed the investment return
necessary to clear the market for such bonds--that is, to
attract enough buyers so that the demand for bonds
matches the amount supplied. (In order to attract sufficient
buyers in lower tax brackets to sell all of the bonds,
issuers have to offer higher yields than are necessary to
attract at least some of the buyers in higher tax brackets.)</p>

<p>Second, the amount of the federal subsidy for borrowing
would be explicit and unaffected by other federal policy
decisions. Currently, for example, the savings in financing
costs that are realized by issuing governmental or qualified
private activity bonds are largely determined indirectly
by other features of the federal tax code (such as
bond buyers' tax brackets, which are an important determinant
of the demand for such debt).</p>

<p>Third, making subsidy payments to the issuers of bonds
could improve federal budgeting practices. The subsidies
provided under current law are not readily visible in the
budget; in contrast, under this option, the federal government
would know the exact amount of financing subsidies
it was providing in a given fiscal year. As a result,
policymakers would be able to accurately assess the cost
of the subsidies in comparison with the cost of other
types of assistance to state and local governments and
other spending more generally.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of the option is that it could raise borrowing
costs for issuers of tax-preferred debt and thereby
deter some investment that might have national benefits
or place greater burdens on already strained state and
local budgets. A subsidy payment rate of 15 percent is
at the lower end of the range of estimated annual reductions
in interest payments attributable to the exclusion
of bondholders' income from federal taxes. Thus, state
and local governments and some private entities would
probably have to pay more to borrow, which in turn
could cause them to reduce their spending on capital
projects, such as schools and roads, and on existing
programs (because general tax revenues are often used
both to pay principal and interest on debt and to fund
ongoing government operations). Borrowing costs could
rise even further if lenders became fearful that transforming
the subsidy from a tax exclusion to a more visible
expenditure program would lead to further reductions
(and potentially elimination) of the subsidy in the future
and, as a consequence, charged higher rates of interest.</p>

<p>However, the option could increase or decrease demand
for tax-preferred debt, and it is therefore unclear whether
borrowing costs would fall or rise. On the one hand,
offering a taxable--and thus higher--yield on bonds
issued by state and local governments would make that
debt attractive to new types of bond buyers (such as
managers of pension funds and foreign investors, who
generally do not pay U.S. taxes). The demand created by
those purchasers could lower borrowing costs. On the
other hand, the demand for tax-preferred bonds could fall
as a result of converting the tax exclusion on interest
income into a direct subsidy payment. That is because
the option would reduce the after-tax returns on such
bonds for people who are in higher tax brackets (although
the yield would be higher, they would pay taxes on all of
the interest income they received) and, as a result, could
lead them to buy fewer of those bonds.</p>

<p>If a 15 percent credit were to result in higher borrowing
costs that deterred investments considered desirable
by the federal government, the amount of the subsidy
payment could be increased, either overall--say, from
15 percent to 20 percent or 25 percent--or in a way that
depended upon the purpose for which a bond was issued.
However, increasing the subsidy rate would yield less
savings for the federal government.</p>
