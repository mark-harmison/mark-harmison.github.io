<div><a name="TAX23"></a><h1>Repeal the Deduction for Domestic Production Activities</h1>

<p>The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allows businesses
to deduct from their taxable income a percentage
of what they earn from qualified domestic production
activities. Set at 3 percent for tax years 2005 and 2006,
the deduction rose to 6 percent for tax years 2007
through 2009 and to 9 percent for tax year 2010 and
thereafter. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of
2008 reduced the deduction rate for oil-related qualified
production activities to 6 percent for tax years after 2009.</p>

<p>Various activities qualify for the deduction:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Lease, rental, sale, exchange, or other disposal of tangi
ble personal property, computer software, or sound
recordings, if they are manufactured, produced,
grown, or extracted in whole or significant part in the
United States;</li>
<li>
Production of films (other than those that are sexually
explicit);</li>
<li>
Production of electricity, natural gas, or potable water;</li>
<li>
Construction or renovation; and</li>
<li>
Performance of engineering or architectural services.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list of qualified activities specifically excludes the sale
of food or beverages prepared at retail establishments; the
transmission or distribution of electricity, natural gas, or
potable water; and many activities that would otherwise
qualify except that the proceeds come from sales to a
related business.</p>

<p>The deduction for domestic production activities was created
in part to replace the tax code's extraterritorial
income exclusion--which allowed businesses to exclude
income from certain types of transactions that generate
receipts from trade with foreign countries. According to
the World Trade Organization, that exclusion violated its
agreements by subsidizing exports. The deduction was
intended to reduce the taxes on income from domestic
production without violating the organization's rules.</p>

<p>This option would repeal the deduction for domestic
production activities. Doing so would increase revenues
by $67 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by $163 billion
from 2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>One argument in favor of this option is that it would
reduce economic distortions. Although the deduction is
targeted toward investments in domestic production
activities, it does not apply to all domestic production.
Whether a business activity qualifies for the deduction is
unrelated to the economic merits of the activity. Thus,
the deduction gives businesses an incentive to invest in a
particular set of domestic production activities and to
forgo other, perhaps more economically beneficial,
investments in domestic production activities that do not
qualify.</p>

<p>In addition, to comply with the law, businesses must satisfy
a complex and evolving set of statutory and regulatory
rules for allocating gross receipts and business
expenses to the qualified activities. Companies that want
to take full advantage of the deduction may incur large
tax-planning costs (for example, fees to tax advisers).
Moreover, the complexity of the rules can cause conflict
between businesses and the Internal Revenue Service
regarding which activities qualify under the provision.</p>

<p>An argument against implementing this option is that
simply repealing the deduction for domestic production
activities would increase the cost of domestic business
investment and could reduce the amount of such investment.
Alternatively, the deduction could be replaced with
a revenue-neutral reduction in the top corporate tax rate
(a cut that would reduce revenues by the same amount
that eliminating the deduction would increase them).
That alternative would end the current distortions
between activities that qualify for the deduction and
those that do not. It also would reduce the extent to
which the corporate tax favors noncorporate investments
over investments in the corporate sector and foreign
activities over domestic business activities.</p>
