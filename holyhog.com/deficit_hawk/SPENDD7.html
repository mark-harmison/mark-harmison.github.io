<div><a name="SPENDD7"></a><h1>Replace the Joint Strike Fighter Program with F-16s and F/A-18s</h1>

<p>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is the military's
largest aircraft development program. The program's
objective is to design and produce three versions of
the stealthy aircraft: a conventional takeoff version for the
Air Force; a carrier-based version for the Navy; and a
short takeoff vertical landing (STOVL) version for the
Marine Corps. The Departments of the Navy and the Air
Force placed orders for 101 F-35s from 2007 through
2011 and anticipate purchasing 2,342 more from 2012
through 2035. The Department of Defense (DoD) has
estimated that, including the cost to complete development,
the remaining cost for those purchases will amount
to about $260 billion. (All three versions of the aircraft
are still in the developmental stage and will not enter
operational service for several years.)</p>

<p>Under this option, DoD would cancel the F-35 program
and instead purchase the most advanced versions of
fighter aircraft already in production: the Lockheed Martin
F-16 for the Air Force, and the Boeing F/A-18 for the
Navy and Marine Corps. If those aircraft were purchased
at the rates planned for the F-35, the option would
decrease outlays by about $27 billion over the next five
years. Over the longer term, the option would save
$48 billion through 2021 and $78 billion if the entire
planned fleet of F-35s--not all of which would be purchased
within the 10-year budget window--was replaced
with F-16s and F/A-18s.</p>

<p>The Congressional Budget Office's estimate of savings
under this option is based on information from DoD's
latest available Selected Acquisition Report. Since that
report was prepared, DoD has announced that the JSF
program has experienced substantial cost increases and
schedule delays. CBO lacked sufficient details about
those changes to produce a revised estimate of the
savings that could be realized under this option. Savings
from canceling the F-35 program would probably be
significantly greater than CBO's estimate for the entire
production run (now likely to include purchases beyond
2035, if production quantities remain unchanged). How
much the potential savings over the next 5 or 10 years
will change depends on the degree to which purchases are
postponed to accommodate delays in development and
increases in cost.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that--if equipped
with upgraded modern radar, precision weapons, and
digital communications--new F-16s and F/A-18s would
be sufficiently advanced to meet the threats that the
nation is likely to face in the foreseeable future. The
extreme sophistication of the F-35 and the additional
technical challenge of building three distinct types of aircraft
with a common airframe and engine have resulted in
significant cost growth and schedule delays. Although the
F-35 program was recently restructured and further
changes have been announced, additional cost growth
and schedule delays remain a possibility. The cost of
upgrading the other aircraft also could escalate, but their
lesser technical challenges relative to the F-35 would
make comparable cost growth unlikely. Because the Air
Force and the Navy project that planned production rates
for the F-35 would be insufficient to meet inventory
goals as older aircraft needed to be retired, schedule
delays for that aircraft could be particularly problematic.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of this option is that F-16 and F/A-18 aircraft
lack the stealth design features that would help the
F-35 evade enemy radar and hence operate more safely in
the presence of enemy air defenses. The services would
maintain some stealth capability, however, with the B-2
bomber and F-22 fighters already in the force. Any
greater need for stealth capabilities that might arise in the
future could be addressed with new, highly stealthy
unmanned fighters and long-range bombers that the services
plan to develop. Another potential disadvantage of
this option is that substituting F/A-18s for the F-35B-- the AV-8B Harrier. Those strike groups would be left to
the Marine Corps' STOVL version of the F-35--would rely on armed helicopters (which lack the range, speed,
remove that service's capability to operate fixed-wing payload, and survivability of the F-35) or on other forces,
fighters from the amphibious assault ships in naval expe-such as aircraft from aircraft carrier strike groups.
