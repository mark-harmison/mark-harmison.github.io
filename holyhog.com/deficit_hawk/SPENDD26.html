<div><a name="SPENDD26"></a><h1>Drop Wealthier Communities from the Community Development Block Grant Program</h1>

<p>The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program provides annual grants to communities to aid
low-and moderate-income households, eliminate municipal
blight, meet emergency needs, rehabilitate housing,
improve infrastructure, and promote economic development.
Under one component of the program, which is
administered by the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), grants go directly to cities and
urban counties, referred to as entitlement communities.
(Other CDBG funds are allocated to states, which typically
distribute them through a competitive process to
smaller, more rural communities known as nonentitlement
areas.) Funds from the entitlement component also
may be used to repay bonds issued by local governments
and guaranteed by the federal government under the
Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program (established along
with the CDBG program by the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974). For 2010, $4.0 billion
was appropriated for the CDBG program, of which
$2.8 billion was designated for entitlement communities.</p>

<p>Under current law, the CDBG entitlement program is
open to all urban counties, principal cities of metropolitan
areas, and cities with a population of at least 50,000.
The program allocates funds according to a formula
based on a community's population, the number of residents
in poverty, the number of housing units with more
than one person per room, the number of housing units
built before 1940, and the extent to which population
growth since 1960 is below the average for all metropolitan
cities. The formula does not require a certain community
poverty rate, nor does it exclude communities
with high average income. In an analysis conducted in
2003, HUD showed that when population data and
other information were updated using results from the
2000 census, funding provided on the basis of the formula
shifted from poorer to wealthier communities, as
measured by average poverty rates.</p>

<p>This option would reduce funding for CDBG entitlement
grants and direct the remaining funding to needier
communities. The option could be implemented in a
variety of ways, but one approach would be to exclude
communities with per capita income that exceeded the
national average by more than a specified percentage--
for example, the communities with per capita income
greater than 105 percent of the national average, which
accounted for 23.4 percent of the entitlement funds in
2010. The option presented here illustrates the general
approach without specifying a particular form of implementation:
It would cut funding for the entitlement
grants by 20 percent, saving about $2 billion over 5 years
and about $5 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>One argument in favor of this option, or of a more substantial
reduction, is that it is not appropriate to use federal
funds for local development. An alternative argument
is that even if the program is viewed as meeting national
needs that some local governments cannot address adequately,
that rationale does not justify redirecting money
to wealthier communities.</p>

<p>The main argument against this option is that dropping
wealthier communities from the CDBG program could
reduce efforts to aid low-income households within those
communities unless local governments reallocated their
own funds to offset the lost grants.</p>
