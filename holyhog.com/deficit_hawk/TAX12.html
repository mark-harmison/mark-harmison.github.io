<div><a name="TAX12"></a><h1>Reduce Limits on Contributions to Retirement Plans</h1>

<p>Current law allows taxpayers to make contributions to
certain types of tax-preferred retirement plans up to a
limit that varies depending on the type of plan and the
age of the taxpayer. The most common such vehicles are
401(k) plans, which are sponsored by employers, and
individual retirement accounts (IRAs), which are maintained
by the participants themselves.</p>

<p>Individuals under the age of 50 may contribute up to
$16,500 to 401(k) and similar employment-based plans
in 2011; participants ages 50 and above are also allowed
to make "catch-up" contributions of up to $5,500,
enabling them to make as much as $22,000 in total
contributions in 2011. In general, those limits apply to
contributions to all types of employment-based plans
combined. However, contributions to 457(b) plans,
available primarily to employees of state and local governments,
are subject to a separate limit. As a result, employees
who are enrolled in both 401(k) and 457(b) plans can
contribute the maximum amount to both plans, thereby
allowing some people to make tax-preferred contributions
of as much as $44,000 in a single year.</p>

<p>In 2011, IRA contribution limits are $5,000 for those
under age 50 and $6,000 for those ages 50 and above.
The limits on deductible amounts are phased out above
certain income thresholds if either the taxpayer or the
taxpayer's spouse is covered by an employment-based
plan. Contribution limits for all types of plans are
indexed for inflation but increase only in $500
increments.</p>

<p>This option would reduce contribution limits, regardless
of a taxpayer's age, to $14,850 for 401(k)-type plans and
$4,500 for IRAs. Furthermore, it would suspend the
indexing of those limits for five years. Finally, it would
require all contributions to employment-based plans--
including 457(b) plans--to be subject to a single combined
limit. If implemented, the option would increase
revenues by $16 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by
$46 billion from 2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>One argument in favor of this option centers on fairness.
The tax savings associated with these retirement plans--
particularly the employment-based plans that do not have
income restrictions--increase with the participant's
income tax rate and the amount of his or her contribution.
Thus, a worker in the 15 percent tax bracket defers
taxes of 15 cents on each dollar contributed to a 401(k)
plan, while an employee in the 35 percent tax bracket
defers taxes of 35 cents. That larger tax benefit per dollar
saved is enhanced for higher-income taxpayers because
they tend to save more. Consequently, the taxpayers who
would be most affected by the option are primarily
higher-income individuals. The limits on 401(k) contributions
affect few taxpayers--only 5 percent of participants
in 2003--but of those affected, 64 percent had
income in excess of $160,000 that year. The option also
would level the playing field between those who currently
benefit from higher contribution limits (people ages 50
and over and employees of state and local governments)
and those subject to lower limits.</p>

<p>In addition to enhancing fairness, the option would
improve economic efficiency. A goal of tax-preferred
retirement plans is to increase private saving (although at
the cost of some public saving). However, the higher-
income individuals who are constrained by the current
limits on contributions are most likely to be those who
can fund the tax-preferred accounts out of existing savings
without responding to the intended incentive to
actually save more. Thus, the option would increase
public saving--by reducing the deficit--at the cost of
very little private saving.</p>

<p>The main argument against this option is that it would
reduce the retirement saving of a significant number of
people, particularly those who find it difficult to save
because of income constraints or family responsibilities.</p>

<p>Although only 5 percent of workers with income under would adversely affect those ages 50 and over who might
$80,000 in 2003 contributed to IRAs, more than 40 per-have failed to save enough for a comfortable retirement
cent of those people contributed the maximum amount while raising their families. The amount they could
permitted. Those workers generally have relatively little contribute to tax-preferred retirement accounts would be
in accumulated savings and are more likely to respond cut at precisely the time when reduced family obligations
to the incentive to save than are people in higher-income and impending retirement make them more likely to
groups. Eliminating the catch-up contribution limits respond to tax incentives to save more.</p>
