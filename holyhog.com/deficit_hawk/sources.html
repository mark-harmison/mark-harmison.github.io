            <h2>Source of Information</h2>

            <p>All the information presented in this app comes from a single Congressional Budget Office
                document called <a target="_new" href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12085">Reducing the Deficit: Spending and
                    Revenue Options</a>. We have made reasonable efforts to make sure that the numbers have been
                transcribed correctly, but given the manual nature of the process it is almost innevitable that some
                errors will have crept in. Please report any errors you find to support@holyhog.com and we will
                fix them promptly.</p>

            <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>

            <p>We wrote this app as a "blitz" project after getting upset by the generally mindless nature of the
            debate on our current budget deficit situation.  The point of the app is to help citizens understand
            how complex and difficult the choices are, and to let you experiment with what you think are appropriate
            compromises to reduce spending and/or increase revenue.  We have no other agenda that that.</p>

            <h2>What to do with this information</h2>

            <p>If you come up with a solution to the deficit that you want to share then use Menu -> Share to email
            it to yourself or friends, or send your solution to your elected representatives</p>
