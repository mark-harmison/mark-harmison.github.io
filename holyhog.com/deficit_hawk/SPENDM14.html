<div><a name="SPENDM14"></a><h1>Adopt a Voucher Plan and Slow the Growth of Federal Contributions for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program</h1>

<p>The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program
provides health insurance coverage to approximately
4 million federal workers and annuitants as well as to
approximately 4 million of their dependents and survivors.
In 2011, those benefits are expected to cost the government
almost $41 billion (including amounts paid by
the U.S. Postal Service). Policyholders are required to pay
25 percent of the premium for the lowest-cost plans available
and generally a larger share for higher-cost plans; the
federal government pays the remainder of the premium.
Retired enrollees pay the same premiums that active
employees pay, and the federal government typically
shares in the cost of the premiums to the same extent for
both groups. That premium-sharing structure provides
some incentive for federal employees to switch from
higher-premium to lower-premium plans, although the
incentive is less than it would be if employees realized the
full savings from choosing a less expensive plan. The
premium-sharing structure also imposes some competitive
pressure on plans to hold down premiums.</p>

<p>This option would offer a voucher for the FEHB program
that would cover roughly the first $5,000 of an
individual premium or the first $11,000 of a family premium
beginning on January 1, 2013. Those amounts,
which are based on the Congressional Budget Office's
estimate of the government's average expected contribution
in 2012, would increase annually at the rate of inflation
as measured by the consumer price index for all
urban consumers, rather than at the average weighted rate
of change in FEHB premiums. According to CBO's estimates,
indexing vouchers to inflation rather than to the
growth of premiums would produce budgetary savings
because FEHB premiums are predicted to grow significantly faster than inflation. (The expected cost growth in
FEHB premiums is similar to expected growth in other
private insurance premiums.)</p>

<p>This option would reduce discretionary spending by federal
agencies (because of lower payments for FEHB premiums
for current employees and their dependents) by
an estimated $8 billion over the 2012-2016 period and
by $42 billion over the 2012-2021 period, under the
assumption that appropriations reflect the reduced costs.
The option would also reduce mandatory on- and off-
budget spending because of lower payments from the
Treasury and the U.S. Postal Service for FEHB premiums
for retirees. Estimated savings from those reductions
would be roughly $6 billion over the 2012-2016 period
and about $32 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>In addition, CBO anticipates, the option would cause
some FEHB participants to leave the program and enroll
in health insurance exchanges starting in 2014.1 As a
result, health exchange subsidy costs would increase by
$100 million over the 2012-2016 period and $500 million
over the 2012-2021 period, and revenues would fall
by about $30 million over the 2012-2016 period and
about $150 million over the 2012-2021 period. Also,
some FEHB annuitants could leave the program and
enroll in Medicare Part D (the prescription drug benefit)
to obtain drug coverage that they had previously had
through the FEHB program. As a result, Medicare spending
would increase by an estimated $100 million over the
2012-2016 period and $500 million over the 2012-
2021 period. Overall, the option would reduce mandatory
spending, on net, by an estimated $6 billion over
5 years and almost $32 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>Under this option, employees who selected plans that
cost more than the voucher amount would pay the full
additional cost of the plan. Therefore, this option would
increase the incentive to choose lower-premium plans
and would strengthen price competition among health
care plans participating in the FEHB program. In particular,
because enrollees would pay nothing for plans that
cost as much as the value of the voucher, insurers would
have a greater incentive to offer lower-premium plans
whose cost approached or matched that value.</p>

<p>This option could have several drawbacks. First, because
the federal contribution would grow more slowly over
time than premiums, the option would reduce benefits.
Participants would eventually pay more for their health
insurance coverage; the FEHB enrollee premium contribution
would increase by more than $2,000, on average,
by 2021, CBO estimates. Some employees and annuitants
who would be covered under current law might
decide to forgo coverage altogether. For the most part,
large private-sector companies currently provide health
care benefits for their employees that are comparable to
benefits that the government provides; under this option,
government benefits could be less attractive than private-
sector benefits, making it harder for the government to
attract highly qualified workers. Finally, this option
would cut benefits that many current federal retirees and
federal employees looking ahead to retirement may
believe they have already earned.</p>
