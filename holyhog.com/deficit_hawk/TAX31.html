<div><a name="TAX31"></a><h1>Increase the Payroll Tax Rate for Medicare Hospital Insurance by 1 Percentage Point</h1>

<p>The primary source of financing for Hospital Insurance
(HI) benefits provided under Medicare Part A is the HI
payroll tax. The HI tax is currently 2.9 percent of earnings,
half of which is deducted from employees' paychecks
and half of which is paid by employers. Self-
employed individuals pay 2.9 percent of their net income
in HI taxes. Unlike the payroll tax for Social Security,
which applies to earnings up to an annual maximum
($106,800 in 2011), the HI tax is levied on total
earnings.</p>

<p>Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
2010 (Public Law 111-148), the portion of the HI tax
that employees pay will increase by 0.9 percent of earnings
in excess of $200,000, beginning in 2013. For a married
couple filing an income tax return jointly, the surtax
will apply to the couple's combined earnings above
$250,000.</p>

<p>In recent years, expenditures for the HI program have
grown at a much faster pace than revenues derived from
the payroll tax. The Congressional Budget Office estimates
that, in fiscal year 2011 and in most years thereafter,
expenditures for HI will exceed the program's total
income (including interest credited to the trust fund),
which will necessitate that balances in the HI trust fund
be drawn down. CBO projects that the balances will fall
sharply during the 10-year budget period and will be
exhausted in 2021.</p>

<p>This option would replace the 0.9 percent surtax on
high-income taxpayers with a 1.0 percentage point
increase in the total HI tax on all earnings. The HI tax
rate for both employers and employees would increase by
0.5 percentage points to 1.95 percent, resulting in a combined
rate of 3.9 percent. The rate paid by self-employed
people would also rise to 3.9 percent. For taxpayers with
income above $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples
filing jointly), the portion of the HI tax that employees
pay on income in excess of the surtax threshold would
effectively be reduced from 2.35 percent to 1.95 percent;
the portion that employers pay would increase from</p>

<p>1.45 percent to 1.95 percent.
If implemented, the option would increase revenues by
$286 billion over the 2012-2016 period and by $651 billion
over the 2012-2021 period. (The estimates include
the reduction in individual income tax revenues that
would result from a shift of some labor compensation
from a taxable to a nontaxable form.)</p>

<p>The main argument for the option is that the HI payroll
tax is currently not sufficient to cover the costs of the program,
as indicated by the prospective insolvency of the
HI trust fund. Increasing that tax would boost the revenues
that flowed to the HI trust fund to a substantial
degree and keep the fund solvent for a longer period. A
commonly used measure of the long-term financial status
of Medicare Part A is the actuarial balance--that is, the
present value of revenues (primarily from payroll taxes)
plus the current trust fund balance minus the present
value of outlays for the program and the desired trust
fund outlays (one year's worth) at the end of a specified
period.1 CBO projects that the actuarial imbalance for
the HI trust fund over the next 75 years is 2.4 percent of
taxable payroll, which is the difference between projected
income-- 4.2 percent of taxable payroll--and projected
costs--6.5 percent of taxable payroll. Eliminating a gap
of that size would require, as an example, either an immediate
increase in the HI payroll tax rate, from its current
2.9 percent to 5.3 percent, or an immediate cut of about
one-third in spending on Part A. By raising the HI tax by
1 percentage point for most people (and by 0.1 percentage
point for higher-income individuals), the option
would delay the exhaustion of the HI trust fund by several
decades but would not entirely eliminate the long-
term gap between projected income and projected costs.</p>

<p>Another argument in favor of the option concerns tax
administration. An increase in the overall payroll tax
would be simpler to administer than the surtax that will
go into effect in 2013. Another advantage of the option
is that it would eliminate the marriage penalties that will
result after the new surtax goes into effect. Under the
surtax, two single people can each earn up to $200,000--
for a combined total of $400,000--without becoming
subject to the higher tax rate in 2013. However, if
they were to marry, the two workers would be subject to
the surtax on their combined earnings in excess of
$250,000. Because the HI payroll tax is based on individual
earnings, increasing the HI tax rate--instead of
imposing the surtax--would eliminate that penalty.</p>

<p>The option would have several drawbacks. When the surtax
goes into effect in 2013, it will encourage taxpayers
with income above the thresholds to reduce the hours
they work or to shift their compensation away from tax-
able earnings to nontaxable forms of compensation.
Increasing the HI tax rate, as called for under the option,
would extend those disincentives to all workers. When
employees reduce the hours they work or change the
composition of their earnings, economic resources are
allocated less efficiently than would be the case in the
absence of the higher tax rate.</p>

<p>Another drawback of the option is that an increase in the
HI payroll tax rate, combined with the elimination of the
surtax, would be relatively more burdensome for low- and
middle-income workers than for higher-income earners.
First, low- and middle-income workers and their employers
would face larger rate increases relative to current law
than would higher-income earners (whose rates have just
increased as a result of the health care legislation) and
their employers. Second, taxable wages make up a smaller
proportion of income for higher-income earners than for
low-and middle-income workers. Although all workers
would pay the same percentage of earnings in HI taxes,
higher-income households would pay a smaller percentage
of their total income because those households derive
a greater share of income from sources other than wages
(such as capital income and rental income), which are not
subject to the HI payroll tax.</p>
