<div><a name="SPENDM3"></a><h1>Reduce the Size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve</h1>

<p>The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is a stock of crude
oil that the government owns and stores at four underground
sites along the Gulf of Mexico. The SPR, which
can hold about 727 million barrels of oil, was established
in 1975 to help insulate the United States against a severe
disruption in oil supplies. With a final shipment of about
half a million barrels, the SPR was filled to capacity in
December 2009. The Department of Energy (DOE) is
authorized to expand the SPR's capacity to 1 billion barrels.
DOE can draw oil from the reserve at a maximum
sustained rate of 4.4 million barrels per day (or about
44 percent of average daily U.S. oil imports and about
22 percent of average daily U.S. petroleum consumption)
for about 90 days; after that, the maximum draw rate is
less.</p>

<p>This option would reduce the SPR's holdings by about
10 percent during the 2012-2016 period and then
maintain a reserve of 650 million barrels. In the Congressional
Budget Office's estimation, selling the excess hold-
ings--about 75 million barrels of oil--would generate
$700 million in 2012 and roughly $6 billion over five
years, net of estimated decommissioning costs. That estimate
assumes that DOE will receive slightly more than
$90 per barrel, consistent with CBO's January 2011 economic
projection. The estimate does not include savings
from forgoing expansion of the SPR.</p>

<p>Oil has seldom been withdrawn from the SPR. In 1996,
DOE sold 28 million barrels at the direction of lawmakers
in order to reduce the federal budget deficit.
DOE also sold a combined 5 million barrels in test sales
in 1985 and 1990. Since 1996, DOE has released--to
respond to temporary supply disruptions or to exchange
one grade of crude oil for another--a total of about
68 million barrels to private firms through negotiated
exchange agreements under which the companies have
later replaced the oil, with interest. Only twice has oil
been sold from the SPR in response to an emergency,
and each of those sales involved only a small fraction of
the reserve's holdings. Citing the risk of economically
threatening disruptions in supply, DOE sold about
17 million barrels during the 1991 Gulf War and about
11 million barrels after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p>

<p>Most arguments in favor of this option concern changes
over time in the benefits and costs associated with the
reserve. The increasing diversity of world oil supplies and
growing integration of the economies of oil-producing
and oil-consuming nations have probably lessened the
risk of a sustained, widespread disruption. Large structural
shifts in energy markets and in the U.S. economy
since 1975 have moderated the likely costs of a disruption
in oil supplies and, thus, the benefits that might
accrue from releasing oil in a crisis. In addition, the government's
ability to smooth oil prices by selling oil from
the SPR at times of increasing world oil prices, or by purchasing
oil for the SPR when world oil prices are declining,
may be limited because SPR sales or purchases would
represent only a very small fraction of world oil consumption.
Moreover, the cost of maintaining SPR facilities has
escalated as those facilities have aged. Finally, analysis of
past sales and withdrawals from the SPR suggests that a
10 percent reduction in its holdings probably would not
compromise its ability to address the types of problems
that have triggered past releases.</p>

<p>Several arguments can be made against this option. If the
capacity of the SPR is not expanded and U.S. demand for
oil continues to grow, the SPR will eventually be unable
to hold the equivalent of 90 days' worth of net oil
imports in reserves of oil or petroleum products. (The
United States and other nations have made a commitment
to the International Energy Agency to hold reserves
in at least that amount.) In 2010, the SPR held the equivalent
of about 79 days' worth of net oil imports. Estimates
in the Energy Information Agency's (EIA's) Annual
Energy Outlook 2011 suggest that the SPR will hold, at
capacity, between 65 and 105 days' worth of net oil
imports in 2021, depending on future crude oil prices
and associated demand. The EIA's central projection of
future oil demand implies an 82-day supply in the SPR</p>
