<div><a name="TAX5"></a><h1>Limit or Eliminate the Deduction for State and Local Taxes</h1>

<p>In determining their taxable income, taxpayers may
choose the standard deduction when they file their tax
returns or they may itemize and deduct certain expenses
(including state and local taxes on income, real estate,
and personal property) from their adjusted gross income
(AGI). Under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,
taxpayers who itemized were allowed to deduct state and
local sales taxes, which previously had not been deductible,
instead of state and local income taxes. The Tax
Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and
Job Creation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-312, referred
to in this report as the 2010 tax act) extended that provision
through 2011. Beginning in 2013, with the expiration
of the 2010 tax act, the total value of certain itemized
deductions--including the deduction for state and
local taxes--will be reduced if the taxpayer's AGI is above
a specified threshold.</p>

<p>This option would change the deductibility of state and
local tax payments, either by eliminating the deduction
or by restricting it to an amount equal to or less than
2 percent of AGI. Eliminating the deduction would
increase federal revenues by $345 billion from 2012
through 2016 and by $862 billion from 2012 through
2021. Capping the deduction at 2 percent of AGI would
increase revenues by $253 billion over five years and by
$629 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>Those revenue estimates reflect the assumption that the
alternative minimum tax (AMT) would continue to
operate as it does under current law. (Federal tax liability
is computed differently under the AMT than it is under
the regular income tax because the former allows a more
limited set of exemptions, deductions, and tax credits;
taxpayers pay the higher of their regular tax or the AMT.)
Because the deduction for state and local taxes is the largest
item that must be added back into income under the
AMT, assumptions regarding the AMT have a substantial
effect on the revenue estimates for this option. Under
current law, the number of taxpayers who pay the AMT
will grow each year because the exemption amounts and
brackets for the AMT are not indexed for inflation. As
the scope of the AMT expands, fewer people will benefit
from the deduction for state and local taxes. However,
policymakers have routinely changed the requirements to
limit the number of taxpayers affected by the AMT. If
legislation that limited AMT liability was already in
place, more taxpayers would benefit from the deduction
for state and local taxes--and eliminating that deduction
would result in a larger revenue gain than would be the
case under current law.</p>

<p>The deduction for state and local taxes is effectively a federal
subsidy to state and local governments. As such, it
indirectly finances spending by those governments at the
expense of other uses of federal revenues. Either variation
of this option would substantially reduce the incentive
that the current subsidy provides for state and local government
spending, although some research indicates that
total state and local spending is not sensitive to that
incentive.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of curtailing the deduction is that
the federal government should not subsidize state and
local governments through the tax deduction because
state and local taxes are largely paid in return for services
provided to the public. If that is the case, such taxes are
analogous to spending on other types of consumption,
which are nondeductible. Another argument is that the
deduction largely benefits wealthier localities, where
many taxpayers itemize, are in the upper income tax
brackets, and enjoy more abundant state and local
government services. Because the value of an additional
dollar of itemized deductions increases with the marginal
tax rate (the rate on the last dollar of income), the deductions
are worth more to taxpayers in higher income tax
brackets than they are to those in lower income brackets.
Additionally, the deductibility of taxes could deter states
and localities from financing services with nondeductible
fees, which could be more efficient.</p>

<p>An argument against eliminating or restricting the current
deduction involves the equity of the tax system. A
person who must pay relatively high state and local taxes
has less money with which to pay federal taxes than does
someone with the same total income and smaller state
and local tax bills. The validity of that argument, however,
depends at least in part on whether people who pay
higher state and local taxes also benefit more from goods
and services provided by states and localities.</p>
