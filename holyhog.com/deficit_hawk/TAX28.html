<div><a name="TAX28"></a><h1>Increase Excise Taxes on Motor Fuels by 25 Cents</h1>

<p>Revenues from federal excise taxes on motor fuels are
credited to the Highway Trust Fund to pay for highway
construction and maintenance as well as for investment
in mass transit. Those taxes currently are set at 18.4 cents
per gallon of gasoline and 24.4 cents per gallon of diesel
fuel produced. (State and local excise taxes bring total
average tax rates nationwide to about 48 cents per gallon
of gasoline and 54 cents per gallon of diesel fuel.)</p>

<p>This option would increase federal excise taxes on gasoline
and diesel fuel by 25 cents per gallon, to 43.4 cents
per gallon of gasoline and 49.4 cents per gallon of diesel
fuel. That change would increase federal revenues by
$140 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by a total
of $291 billion over 10 years. (Because excise taxes
reduce the tax base for income and payroll taxes, higher
excise taxes would lead to reductions in revenues from
those sources. The estimates shown here reflect those
reductions.)</p>

<p>A rationale for increasing excise taxes on motor fuels is
that the rates currently in effect are not sufficient to fully
fund the federal government's spending on highways. In
addition, economic efficiency is promoted when users of
highway infrastructure are charged according to the marginal
(or incremental) costs of their use, including the
"external costs" that are imposed on society. Because the
current fuel taxes do not cover all of those marginal costs,
higher fuel taxes could more accurately reflect the external
costs created by the consumption of motor fuel. Some
of those costs--including the costs of pollution, climate
change, and dependence on foreign oil--are directly associated
with the amount of motor fuel consumed. But the
larger fraction of those costs is related to the number of
miles that vehicles travel, usage that results in road congestion,
noise, pavement damage, and accidents.</p>

<p>If the cost of fuel was higher, people would drive less or
purchase vehicles that used fuel more efficiently, thus
reducing some of the external costs. (In contrast, paying
for highways and mass transit through general revenues
provides no incentive for the efficient use of those systems.)
Various studies suggest that, in the absence of a tax
on motor fuels or the number of vehicle miles traveled,
the external costs of motor fuels amount to at least $1 per
gallon, indicating that for drivers to cover the costs they
impose on society, excise tax rates on motor fuels would
have to be substantially higher than the current rates.
Under this option, tax rates on motor fuels would more
closely reflect those external costs. In addition, this
option would have relatively low collection costs.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that it could be more
economically efficient to base a tax on the number of
miles that vehicles travel. (Such a usage fee could be
assessed on its own or in conjunction with taxes on motor
fuels.) For example, imposing tolls or implementing congestion
pricing (charging fees for driving at specific times
in given areas) could be better ways to alleviate congestion.
Similarly, a levy on the number of miles driven
could be structured to correspond more closely to the
costs of repairing damaged pavement than could a tax on
motor fuels. However, creating the systems necessary to
administer a tax on the number of vehicle miles traveled
would be more complex than increasing the existing
excise taxes on fuels.</p>

<p>Other arguments against raising taxes on motor fuels
involve issues of fairness. Such taxes impose a proportionately
larger burden, as a share of income, on middle-
and lower-income households (particularly those not
well-served by public transit) than they do on upper-
income households. Similarly, those taxes impose a
disproportionate burden on rural households because
the benefits of reducing vehicle emissions and congestion higher prices for transported retail goods, for instance--
are greatest in densely populated, mostly urban, areas. those higher prices would further increase the relative
