<div><a name="SPENDD11"></a><h1>Delay Fielding of the Army's Ground Combat Vehicle</h1>

<p>The Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program is the
Army's latest attempt to design and field a new combat
vehicle. Its previous attempt, the manned vehicle program
that was part of the Army's larger Future Combat
Systems program was canceled in the spring of 2009.
Army officials have stated that the service needs a vehicle
large enough to carry and protect a full squad of nine
infantry soldiers at one time. In order to meet its goal
of fielding units equipped with GCVs beginning in
2017, the Army would require appropriations totaling
more than $10 billion through 2016: $8.6 billion for
development--that is, to design, test, and evaluate the
vehicle-- plus almost $2 billion to procure the items
needed to begin production. After 2016, the Army
could need as much as $3 billion in funding annually
to purchase 200 vehicles each year.</p>

<p>This option would delay the initial fielding of the GCV
until 2025. From 2012 through 2021, funds currently
planned for developing the GCV would be reduced to
roughly $600 million per year, thereby decreasing the
need for appropriations by more than $2 billion. Under
this option, no procurement funding for the GCV would
be provided between 2012 and 2021, which would
reduce the need for appropriations by an additional
$14 billion. Some of the savings would be used to
develop and purchase upgrades for Bradley Fighting
Vehicles because they will remain in the Army's inventory
through at least 2025, whether or not this option is
implemented. Consequently, the total reduction in
appropriations associated with this option would be
roughly $7 billion through 2021, mostly between 2012
and 2016. In total, this option would lower outlays by
about $5 billion through 2016 and by almost $6 billion
over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that it would give
the Department of Defense and the Congress time to
evaluate the need for the proposed GCV and to consider
alternative vehicles, as some defense experts have suggested.
Under the Army's plan, GCVs would replace only
about 25 percent of the armored vehicles that the service
uses to transport soldiers on the battlefield. The Army
would still rely on older vehicles that are based on the
chassis of the M113 armed personnel carrier and on
Bradley Fighting Vehicles to provide the bulk of its
armored combat vehicles. The Army has already invested
$27 billion between 2004 and 2010 to upgrade existing
Abrams tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles and to purchase
new Stryker vehicles, and continuing upgrades
would still be required even if the Army proceeded with
the GCV program.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that if the Army eventually
purchased some form of the GCV--because that
vehicle would better meet the demands of current and
future operations--delaying those purchases would push
the costs out further into the future and perhaps increase
the total costs over the very long run. It would also delay
the fielding of a combat vehicle with greater capabilities
than those currently available. For instance, the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle cannot carry its own crew and a full
infantry squad at the same time. Keeping a squad
together, which the GCV would allow, would facilitate
tactical planning while the force was moving. That capability
would allow a squad to better synchronize its
actions when it left the vehicle. In addition, the greater
protection afforded by the GCV--especially against
improvised explosive devices--would enhance the safety
of soldiers who conduct the types of close operations
among civilian populations that are becoming increasingly
common. This option could increase the total cost
of the program by adding eight extra years of research and
development before achieving those goals.</p>

<p>A further argument against this option is that the Army
has not fielded a new combat vehicle since the early
1990s. Delaying the fielding of the GCV would mean
that an even larger portion of the Army would continue
to use systems originally developed in the 1980s or earlier
(although those systems have been updated several times
since then). Some of those armored vehicles, notably the
Abrams tank, are not fuel-efficient and require intensive
maintenance. Improving the data processing and connectivity
of those older systems would require that newer
components be integrated into older frames, which can
be a difficult process (although the exact costs are not easily
estimated and are not included in the above estimate).
Finally, retaining old systems might eventually cause the
Army to lose its technological edge and compromise the
service's dominance on the battlefield.</p>
