<div><a name="SPENDM16"></a><h1>Reduce the Floor on Federal Matching Rates for Medicaid Services</h1>

<p>
The federal government pays a share of the costs that
states incur for providing health care services through the
Medicaid program. For most medical services that Medicaid
covers, the percentage of costs paid by the federal
government is determined by the federal medical assistance
percentage (FMAP). The FMAP is based on a formula
that assigns a higher federal reimbursement rate to
states that have lower income per capita, and vice versa.
(Per capita income serves as a proxy for a state's financial
resources.) By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than
50 percent and no more than 83 percent. On average, the
federal matching rate is 57 percent, and states pay the
remaining 43 percent of the cost of services. Beginning in
2009 and continuing through the third quarter of 2011,
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(Public Law 111-5) specified that the federal government
pay a larger share of Medicaid costs, averaging between
about 65 percent and 68 percent, depending on the year.</p>

<p>Starting in 2014, the federal government will pay a different
matching rate, specified in law, for the cost of services
incurred by enrollees made newly eligible for Medicaid
under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(PPACA, P.L. 111-148), as amended by the Health Care
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111152).
The matching rates for those enrollees will vary
from 90 percent to 100 percent, depending on the year,
and are not affected by the FMAP rate formula. Also
starting in 2014, for certain childless adults that some
states made eligible for Medicaid prior to the passage of
PPACA, the federal government will pay a specified percentage
of the difference between the states' FMAP rates
(as determined by the aforementioned formula) and the
rates paid on behalf of those made newly eligible under
PPACA.</p>

<p>Although matching rates are set through formulas specified
in statute, states generally determine the amount of
Medicaid's spending because they pay health care providers
and then submit claims to the federal government for
reimbursement at the appropriate FMAP rate. Medicaid
spending is therefore driven by the choices that states
make regarding payment rates for providers, the coverage
of optional benefits, and the eligibility thresholds for the
program.</p>

<p>This option would lower the 50 percent floor on federal
matching rates to 45 percent starting in 2012 for all
Medicaid-covered services that are reimbursed at the
FMAP rate; the option would not affect the matching
rates for newly eligible enrollees under PPACA. The
affected states would be those with high per capita
income relative to the national average that, in the
absence of the floor, would have FMAP rates lower than
50 percent. Lowering the floor to 45 percent would
reduce FMAP rates for 14 states such that the new rates
would range from 45.0 percent to 49.6 percent. Federal
matching rates would not change for the remaining
37 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>If the federal government reduced the share of Medicaid
that it reimbursed, states would be faced with a choice. At
one extreme, they could substitute additional state spending
for all of the lost federal funding and thereby maintain
their Medicaid programs' payment rates, covered services,
and enrollment levels. At the other extreme, they
could provide no additional state funding and reduce the
size of their Medicaid programs. For this estimate, the
Congressional Budget Office assumed that states would
increase their contributions to make up for some of the
reduced federal funding, but not by enough to prevent a
decline in the size of their Medicaid programs.</p>

<p>This option would reduce federal outlays by $75 billion
during the 2012-2016 period, CBO estimates, and by
$181 billion from 2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>A rationale for lowering the floor on the federal matching
rate is to decrease federal spending for the Medicaid program
by reducing payments to states that have the greatest
financial resources available to fund their programs.
The FMAP formula is designed to provide a larger federal
contribution for states that have lower income per capita
and a smaller federal contribution for states that have
higher income per capita. However, the floor of 50 percent
provides a number of states with FMAP rates above
the rates they would be assigned in the absence of such a
floor. Lowering the current floor would require states that
have higher income per capita to pay a greater share of
the cost of Medicaid services for their populations.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that it would concentrate
significant reductions in federal spending among a
fairly small number of states. The 14 states affected by</p>

<p>the option would generally have several mechanisms for
reducing expenditures in their Medicaid programs: They
could cut their payment rates to providers; they could
reduce the kinds and amounts of medical benefits they
provide; or they could cover fewer people by reducing
outreach efforts that encourage enrollment or by increasing
administrative requirements for enrollment. States
that faced significant reductions in their FMAP rates
would probably respond by using a combination of those
cost-cutting approaches.</p>
