<div><a name="TAX25"></a><h1>Tax the Worldwide Income of U.S. Corporations As It Is Earned</h1>

<p>The income that U.S. businesses earn at home and
abroad is taxed by the federal government and may also
be subject to taxation in the country in which it is earned.
To prevent such double taxation, U.S. companies are
allowed to claim a foreign tax credit, which reduces their
domestic tax liability by the amount of any income and
withholding taxes they pay to foreign governments. The
foreign tax credit is subject to limits that are designed to
ensure that the amount of credits taken does not exceed
the amount of U.S. tax that otherwise would have been
due. Those limits also are intended to prevent corporations
from using foreign tax credits as a way to reduce
taxes on income earned in the United States. For computing
those limits, the overhead expenses (such as interest
costs) that a U.S. parent company incurs for its operations
must be allocated between domestic and foreign
activities. Most of the income that foreign subsidiaries of</p>

<p>U.S. corporations earn is not subject to U.S. taxation
until it is repatriated in the form of dividends that those
subsidiaries pay to the parent corporation.
Under this option, all income earned by the foreign subsidiaries
of U.S. companies would be subject to U.S. taxes
as it was earned, regardless of when it was repatriated. To
prevent double taxation, foreign tax credits would still be
allowed. For determining the limit on those credits, however,
the U.S. parent corporation's overhead expenses
would no longer be allocated between domestic and foreign
activities because all income would be treated identically
and taxed concurrently. Together, those changes
would increase revenues by $50 billion from 2012
through 2016 and by $114 billion over the 2012-2021
period.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that by not taxing
income until it is repatriated as dividends, the current
system reduces the cost of foreign investment relative to
that of domestic investment. This option would eliminate
that bias and thus increase domestic investment,
which in turn would make U.S. workers more productive
and boost their earnings.</p>

<p>Other arguments focus on how such a policy change
would simplify the tax system. Eliminating the rules for
allocating overhead expenses and the provisions that distinguish
between "active" foreign income (which is not
taxed until it is repatriated) and "passive" foreign income
(which is generally taxed as it is earned) would make
international tax rules less complex. In addition, the costs
of tax planning also would decline for U.S. multinational
corporations, which would no longer need to plan the
repatriation of dividends from their foreign subsidiaries.
Finally, enforcing tax rules would be less costly because
U.S. companies would not be able to reduce their worldwide
taxes by treating U.S. income as foreign income.
An argument against this approach is that it would put</p>

<p>U.S. multinational corporations at a competitive disadvantage:
Whereas the cost of foreign investments would
increase for U.S. multinationals, similar investment costs
for foreign multinationals would remain the same. Such a
competitive disadvantage, it is argued, would shift market
share and production toward businesses controlled by
foreign multinationals. Those concerns could be
addressed by reducing U.S. corporate tax rates if such a
policy change was implemented.</p>
