<div><a name="TAX32"></a><h1>Repeal the Individual Health Insurance Mandate</h1>

<p>Two laws enacted in March 2010--the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act
(P.L. 111-152)--require that nearly every resident of
the United States have health insurance coverage by
January 1, 2014. People who do not comply with the
mandate may be charged a penalty that is the greater of a
flat dollar amount or a percentage of their income. The
penalty will be assessed through the individual income
tax. The flat amount per uninsured adult will start at
$95 in 2014 but rise to $695 by 2016 and be adjusted for
inflation after that. The percentage of income--which
applies to income that exceeds the threshold for mandatory
filing of an income tax return (projected to be about
$10,000 for a single filer and about $18,000 for a married
couple in 2014)--will start at 1.0 percent but rise to
2.5 percent in 2016. Exemptions from the penalties are
provided for several categories of people, including those
with taxable income below the filing threshold, unauthorized
immigrants, members of certain religious
groups, and those who obtain a hardship waiver.
Overall, the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of
the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) project that the
federal government will collect $27 billion in penalty
payments from uninsured people through 2021. The
existence of the mandate and its associated penalties will
also affect the federal budget by encouraging people to
obtain federally subsidized insurance coverage through
Medicaid, newly created health insurance exchanges, or
an employment-based plan (which would be subsidized
indirectly because almost no premiums for that coverage
are treated as taxable compensation). Moreover, in a
competitive labor market, the existence of the mandate
will encourage employers to offer coverage to their
workers, thus reducing penalty payments from larger
businesses that do not offer insurance and increasing
payments of tax credits to certain small businesses that
provide coverage.</p>

<p>The option would eliminate the requirement that individuals
obtain health insurance, while maintaining other
provisions of the new health care legislation. The loss of
revenues from eliminating the individual mandate penalties
would increase the deficit; but the estimated savings
from reduced subsidies are greater--yielding net savings
of about $282 billion over the 2012-2021 period. Most
savings (about $149 billion) would come from lower
Medicaid enrollment. On balance, federal subsidies for
the purchase of insurance through the exchanges would
be about $69 billion lower. Primarily because reductions
in employer coverage would result in more taxable compensation
for employees, the removal of the mandate
would increase tax revenues by about $80 billion. The
remainder of the budgetary effect would come from a
modest increase (about $8 billion) in employer penalties
and a modest reduction (about $3 billion) in tax credits
for small businesses.</p>

<p>CBO and JCT estimate that repealing the mandate
would substantially reduce the number of people with
health insurance coverage. Under current law, about
23 million nonelderly residents are projected to be uninsured
in 2021. If this option was implemented, about
39 million people would be uninsured that year. The
increase in the number of people without insurance
would stem from the following changes: About 4 million
fewer people would have employment-based coverage;
about 6 million fewer people would obtain coverage in
the individual market (including individual policies purchased
in the newly established exchanges or directly
from insurers in the nongroup market); and about 6 million
fewer people would have coverage under Medicaid or
the Children's Health Insurance Program.</p>

<p>In the absence of the mandate, CBO estimates, health
insurance premiums for individually purchased coverage
would be higher than they are projected to be under
current law. Insurers would still be required to provide
coverage to any applicant, could not vary premiums to
reflect enrollees' health status or limit coverage of preexisting
medical conditions, and could adjust premiums
on the basis of age only to a limited degree. Relative to
current law, the elimination of the mandate would tend
to reduce insurance coverage among healthier people
more than it would reduce coverage among less healthy
people. However, those "adverse selection" effects would
be mitigated somewhat by other factors--including the
new subsidies for insurance purchased through the
exchanges (which may make health insurance less costly)
and the annual open enrollment periods in the individual
market (which may make it difficult for people to wait
until they become ill in order to obtain coverage). Moreover,
because the subsidies will limit the share of income
that enrollees have to pay for coverage, the impact on
payments by subsidized enrollees would be minimal if
overall premiums rose because of adverse selection. CBO
estimates that such adverse selection would increase premiums
for policies in the individual market, whether purchased
through the insurance exchanges or not, by
15 percent to 20 percent, relative to current law.</p>

<p>Many proponents of this option argue that the decision
to obtain health insurance is a private matter and that the
government should not force people to acquire coverage.
(Some advocates also argue that the mandate is unconstitutional,
but CBO is not in a position to assess that argument.)
Another argument in the option's favor is that the
mandate and its associated penalty would make some
people worse off--either because they would have to
obtain more health insurance than they otherwise would
have chosen to purchase on their own or because they
would have to pay a penalty instead. Another concern is
that using the Internal Revenue Service to enforce the
mandate will increase the complexity of the tax system
and interfere with efforts to fairly administer that system.
In addition, the mandate necessitates new reporting
requirements that will increase the costs of complying
with the tax code for both individuals and their insurers.</p>

<p>Many opponents of the option point to the reductions in
coverage and increases in premiums that are likely to
occur and argue that it is appropriate for the government
to require people to have health insurance in order to prevent
those outcomes. Another argument is that imposing
a penalty on people who do not obtain coverage could
improve economic efficiency. In particular, by increasing
the private costs of being uninsured, the mandate--to the
extent that it encourages people to obtain coverage--may
reduce the social costs of caring for the uninsured. In
many cases, uninsured people pay much less than the
costs of the care they receive, resulting in lower payments
to providers or higher costs for others. In the absence of
a mandate, those social costs would probably increase
relative to what would occur under current law.</p>
