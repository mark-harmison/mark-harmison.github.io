<div><a name="SPENDM8"></a><h1>Lower the Loan Limits on Mortgages Guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</h1>

<p>The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie
Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(Freddie Mac) are government-sponsored enterprises
(GSEs) that were federally chartered to help ensure a stable
supply of financing for residential mortgages, including
those for low- and moderate-income borrowers. Over
the past 40 years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have carried
out that mission in two main ways: by issuing and
guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and
by buying mortgages and MBSs to hold in their portfolios.
Under current law, the entities are temporarily able
to purchase and guarantee mortgages in amounts up to
$729,750 in areas with high housing costs, although that
limit will fall to $625,500 after September 30, 2011. The
limit outside of high-cost areas currently is $417,000,
and regulators can raise that limit if house prices rise. The
two GSEs provided credit guarantees for over 60 percent
of home mortgages originated in 2010, and they also purchased
and retained mortgages.</p>

<p>In September 2008, the federal government took control
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a conservatorship process
after falling housing prices and rising mortgage delinquencies
threatened the GSEs' solvency, impairing their
ability to ensure a steady supply of financing to the secondary
mortgage market. With that shift in control, the
Congressional Budget Office concluded that the institutions
had effectively become government entities whose
operations should be reflected in the federal budget.</p>

<p>This option would set a maximum loan limit of
$417,000 nationally beginning in 2013 and freeze
that limit going forward. The option would retain the
scheduled reduction--to $625,500 starting October 1,
2011--in the loan limit for high-cost areas; thus, no savings
would be realized in 2012. Lower loan limits would
reduce federal subsidies for the GSEs by roughly $1 billion
over the 2012-2016 period and by almost $4 billion
from 2012 to 2021. For consistency, similar changes
could be made to the Federal Housing Administration's
(FHA's) loan limits. Lower limits for FHA loans would
affect discretionary spending subject to appropriations,
but the effects of such changes are not included in these
estimates.</p>

<p>The major advantages of this option are that it could provide
a transition path from conservatorship and restore a
role for the private sector in the secondary mortgage market
while reducing taxpayers' exposure to the risk of
defaults. Current loan limits, which are high compared
with the median price of about $170,000 for an existing
single-family residence in 2010, leave little scope for a
private secondary market, which had been significant
before the financial crisis. The option would also lower
subsidies to affluent borrowers, for whom home ownership
is already subsidized through the tax code. Another
advantage of the option is that it would probably reduce
the amount of capital allocated to housing and shift it
toward other investments that would be more productive.</p>

<p>One disadvantage of this option is that housing markets
remain fragile and any reduction of federal support might
further weaken those markets. The effects would be
greatest in high-cost areas, although some of the negative
effects might be mitigated through increased reliance on
FHA loans. Another disadvantage is that mortgage markets
might become more prone to disruptions in the
supply of credit during periods of acute financial stress. amounts between $417,000 and $625,500 would pay
Reducing the subsidies would also mean that some borinterest
rates that would probably be about a quarter of a
rowers would pay more for mortgages; in particular, once percentage point higher than under current law.
