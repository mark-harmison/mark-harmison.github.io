<div><a name="SPENDM23"></a><h1>Reduce Medicare's Payment Rates Across the Board in High-Spending Areas</h1>

<p>In some parts of the country, Medicare's spending per
beneficiary is unusually high, a circumstance that appears
to be attributable, at least in part, to differences in local
patterns and professional norms of medical practice, and
not just to higher local prices for "inputs" (goods and services
used in the production of services, such as professional
labor, office space, and so forth) or to unusually
sick populations. Researchers have questioned whether
the additional services provided in such high-spending
areas produce improvements in patients' health that are
commensurate with their cost.</p>

<p>In parts of the country where per-beneficiary spending is
unusually high, after accounting for differences in prices
and beneficiaries' health status, this option would apply
across-the-board reductions to Medicare payment rates
for services covered under Parts A and B (the fee-forservice
parts of the program). The first step in determining
those reductions would be to define the geographic
areas to be used for measuring and comparing spending
per beneficiary; the size of such areas has a substantial
effect on the amount of change in mandatory spending
that the option would produce. For this option, each
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) designated by the
Office of Management and Budget would constitute an
area. Then, in each state, all nonmetropolitan regions--
all parts of the state not included in an MSA--would
constitute a single additional area.</p>

<p>Payment rates in the fee-for-service program would
depend on each area's "relative spending"--defined as the
spending per beneficiary in that area, adjusted to reflect
the price of inputs and the health status of beneficiaries in
that area, divided by the average spending per beneficiary
nationwide. (Adjustments for health status would be
based on Medicare's hierarchical condition categories,
which are currently used to adjust payment rates for
Medicare Advantage plans.) Fee-for-service payment rates
under this option would be reduced in areas where relative
spending exceeded 1.1--that is, where adjusted
spending was at least 10 percent higher than the national
average; reductions would equal one-half of the difference
between the region's relative spending and the threshold
of 1.1. For example, a region with relative spending of
1.2--that is, adjusted spending 20 percent above the
national average--would have Medicare payment rates
reduced by 5 percent, or 1.2 minus 1.1, divided by 2.</p>

<p>The reduction in payment rates in high-spending areas
would be phased in over five years and capped at 20 percent.
It would apply to all payments--including those to
hospitals, physicians, and providers of post-acute care--
made on the basis of a fee schedule. Moreover, the reduction
in fee-for-service payment rates would indirectly
reduce Medicare's payments to private Medicare Advantage
plans by reducing the benchmark payment rates for
those plans. If implemented, this option would reduce
Medicare spending by an estimated $12 billion over
5 years and by almost $48 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that it would bring
about more equity among regions in Medicare's spending.
The option also might encourage initiatives in high-
spending areas to reduce the utilization of health care
resources, especially services thought to have only marginal
benefits for patients, and would encourage providers
to deliver services more efficiently. Reductions in
Medicare's Part B expenditures would also lower beneficiaries'
premiums and out-of-pocket payments.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that it would not target
specific medical providers or specific types of services.
In high-spending areas, all medical providers would face
reductions in payment rates, regardless of whether their
practice patterns contributed to the area's unusually high
level of spending. Thus, payments for all services, regardless
of a service's value to a patient, would be reduced.
Medicare beneficiaries might face difficulties in obtaining
certain medical services if providers became less willing to
offer them. In addition, by reducing the revenue of providers,
this option might limit their ability to deliver
high-quality care.</p>
