<div><a name="TAX18"></a><h1>Increase Corporate Income Tax Rates by 1 Percentage Point</h1>

<p>
Most corporations subject to the corporate income tax
calculate their tax liability according to a progressive rate
schedule. The first $50,000 of corporate taxable income
is taxed at a rate of 15 percent; income of $50,000
to $75,000 is taxed at a 25 percent rate; income of
$75,000 to $10 million is taxed at a 34 percent rate;
and income above $10 million is generally taxed at a
rate of 35 percent.1</p>

<p>Although most corporate income falls in the 35 percent
tax bracket, the average tax rate on corporate income
(corporate taxes divided by corporate income) is lower
than 35 percent because of allowable deductions, exclusions,
tax credits, and the lower tax rates that apply to the
first $10 million of income. For example, corporations
can deduct business expenses, including interest paid to
holders of the firm's bonds, from gross income to compute
taxable income. (Dividends paid to shareholders,
however, are not deductible.) Most income earned by the
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations is not subject to
U.S. taxation until it is repatriated in the form of dividends
paid to the parent corporation. To prevent income
earned abroad from being subject to both foreign and
U.S. taxation, the tax code gives U.S. corporations a
credit that reduces their U.S. tax liability on that income
by the amount of income and withholding taxes they
have paid to foreign governments. The foreign tax credit
is subject to limits that are designed to ensure that the
amount of credits taken does not exceed the amount of
U.S. tax that otherwise would have been due.</p>

<p>This option would increase all corporate income tax rates
by 1 percentage point. For example, the corporate
income tax rate would increase to 36 percent for taxable
income above $10 million. The option would increase
revenues by $47 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by
$101 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>The major argument in favor of the option is its simplicity.
As a way to raise revenue, increasing corporate
income tax rates would be easier to implement than most
other types of business tax increases because it would
require only minor changes to the current tax collection
system.</p>

<p>The option would also increase the progressivity of the
tax system to the extent that the corporate income tax is
largely borne by owners of capital, who tend to have
higher incomes than other taxpayers. But the extent to
which the financial burden of the tax ultimately falls on
the owners of corporations, owners of all capital assets, or
workers is unclear. The United States is an open economy,
in which many firms engage in international trade.
Because labor tends to be less mobile than capital in open
economies, some of the corporate income tax burden
might be passed back to workers through reductions in
their compensation over a number of years--making an
increase in corporate tax rates somewhat less progressive.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that it would further
reduce economic efficiency. The current corporate
income tax system already distorts firms' choices about
how to structure the business (for example, whether to
operate as a C corporation, an S corporation, a partnership,
or a sole proprietorship) and whether to finance
investment by issuing debt or by issuing equity. Increasing
corporate income tax rates would make it even more
advantageous for firms to expend resources to qualify as
an S corporation solely as a way to reduce their tax liabilities.
That is because net income from C corporations--
those subject to the corporate income tax--is first taxed
at the business level and then again at the individual level
after it is distributed to shareholders or investors. By contrast,
income from S corporations--which can have no
more than 100 owners and are subject to other restrictions--
is generally free from taxation at the business level
but is taxed under the individual income tax, even if
the income is reinvested in the firm. Raising corporate
tax rates would also encourage companies to increase
their reliance on debt-financing because interest payments,
unlike dividend payments to shareholders, can
be deducted. Carrying more debt might increase some
companies' risk of default. Moreover, the option could
cause businesses to decrease the amounts they invest,
hindering the growth of the economy. An alternative to
this option that would reduce such incentives would be
to lower the tax rate while broadening the tax base.</p>

<p>Another concern raised about the option is that it would
increase the tax rate that corporations--those based in
the United States and those based in foreign countries--
face when they earn income in the United States. Such
an increase would cause the top marginal tax rate (that
applied to the last dollar of income) in the United States
to be higher than the top marginal tax rates that most
other countries have adopted. That would be of concern
if it were to discourage investment in the United States.
Those statutory rates, however, do not reflect the differences
in various countries' tax bases and rate structures
and therefore do not represent the true average tax rates
that multinational firms face. Other factors, such as the
skill level of a country's workforce and its capital stock,
also affect corporations' decisions about where to incorporate
and invest.</p>
