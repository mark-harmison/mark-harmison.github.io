<div><a name="SPENDM9"></a><h1>Increase Guarantee Fees Charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</h1>

<p>The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie
Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(Freddie Mac) are government-sponsored enterprises
(GSEs) that were federally chartered to help ensure a stable
supply of financing for residential mortgages, including
those for low- and moderate-income borrowers. Over
the past 40 years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have carried
out that mission in two main ways: by issuing and
guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and by
buying mortgages and MBSs to hold in their portfolios.
The two GSEs provided credit guarantees for more than
60 percent of home mortgages originated in 2010, and
they also purchased and retained mortgages.</p>

<p>In September 2008, the federal government took control
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a conservatorship process
after falling housing prices and rising mortgage delinquencies
threatened the GSEs' solvency, impairing their
ability to ensure a steady supply of financing to the secondary
mortgage market. With that shift in control, the
Congressional Budget Office concluded that the institutions
had effectively become government entities whose
operations should be reflected in the federal budget.</p>

<p>This option would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
to raise the average guarantee fee they assess on loans in
the MBSs they issue by 5 basis points (100 basis points
are equivalent to 1 percentage point) and to raise the
effective guarantee fee on loans acquired for their portfolios
by the same amount. Those increases, constituting
roughly a 20 percent rise in fees, would reduce federal
costs for the GSEs by $11 billion over the 2012-2016
period and by about $27 billion from 2012 to 2021.</p>

<p>The main advantage of raising guarantee fees would be to
reduce the projected costs of conservatorship. CBO esti
mates that the mortgage guarantees the GSEs issue over
the 2012-2021 period will cost the federal government
nearly $50 billion on a fair-value basis with fees at their
current levels. (That amount reflects the estimated federal
subsidies inherent in the guarantees at the time they are
made--that is, the up-front payment that a private entity
in an orderly market would require to assume the federal
responsibility for the GSEs' obligations.) Increased fees
on the guarantees would reduce those costs. The higher
fees would probably flow through to borrowers in the
form of higher mortgage rates; however, rates on 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage loans eligible for purchase by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac are relatively low, about 5 percent,
in early 2011. This option would provide the GSEs with
flexibility in setting fees for particular borrowers, so the
potential would exist to minimize the adverse effects of
the higher fees on low- and moderate-income borrowers.
Coordination with the GSEs' regulator, the Federal
Housing Finance Agency, would be necessary to ensure
that the increase in average fee income represented an
increase in the rates charged to borrowers with particular
risk characteristics and not a shift toward lending to riskier
borrowers, who already pay higher-than-average rates.
Another advantage of this option is that it would help
address the current underpricing of risk, which could
shift the allocation of capital too far toward housing and
away from more productive activities.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of raising guarantee fees would be
the consequent increase in the cost of borrowing, which
could somewhat reduce demand for housing. Another
drawback would be more limited refinancing opportunities,
which might constrain spending by consumers. Both
of those concerns would be particularly salient as long as
housing markets and the economy remain weak.</p>
