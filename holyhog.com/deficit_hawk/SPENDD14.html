<div><a name="SPENDD14"></a><h1>Reduce Growth in Appropriations for Agencies Other Than the Department of Defense</h1>

<p>The budgets of 14 cabinet-level agencies (excluding the
Department of Defense [DoD]); 21 large independent
agencies; and more than 80 commissions, boards, foundations,
and other federal entities account for almost
50 percent of all discretionary resources.1 The Departments
of Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation,
Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security
received just over half of those funds in 2010.</p>

<p>Aside from DoD and Postal Service personnel, the federal
government spent approximately $175 billion in 2010 on
about 1.3 million civilian employees, the large majority
of whom were paid with discretionary appropriations.
The federal government also makes about $250 billion in
discretionary grants to state and local governments. The
variety of programs that federal agencies administer
provide a wide range of options for absorbing budget cuts
of various magnitudes. Those cuts could be targeted
toward selected agencies, leaving most federal programs
unaffected, or they could be distributed more evenly
among many of them, avoiding the need to drastically
reduce or eliminate any particular program.</p>

<p>This option includes three broad alternatives for reducing
the growth in discretionary funding for nonmilitary
departments and agencies--that is, excluding appropriations
for DoD--relative to the baseline budget projections
of the Congressional Budget Office:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Limit the rate of growth in non-DoD discretionary
resources to an average of 1.2 percent a year, beginning
in 2012; that rate of growth is 1 percentage point
less than the rate of growth in CBO's baseline and
would reduce outlays by just over $325 billion (or
5 percent) over the 2012-2021 period.</li>
<li>
Freeze those discretionary resources at the annualized
level for 2011 under the continuing resolution that
was in effect in February 2011, thereby reducing
outlays by $642 billion (or 10 percent) over the 2012-
2021 period.</li>
<li>
Reduce those resources by 1 percent each year from
the 2011 level, thus decreasing outlays by about
$932 billion (or 15 percent) over the same period.
Under that alternative, non-DoD discretionary
resources would be reduced to their 2008 funding
level--in nominal terms--by 2021. Appropriations in
2021 would be reduced by $213 billion (or 27 percent)
compared with the baseline amount. That
reduction is roughly equivalent to the total discretionary
resources projected under CBO's baseline assumptions
for the Departments of Health and Human
Services, Veterans Affairs, and Agriculture.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the past 10 years, discretionary funding (other than
for DoD) has increased by about 60 percent, or by more
than 30 percent after adjusting for inflation. Thus, federal
agencies would have more buying power than they
had a decade ago even if their budgets were reduced substantially
relative to the amounts in CBO's baseline. If
those discretionary resources had grown at the rate of
inflation since 2001 and continued to do so through
2021, they would total $592 billion in 2021--$185 billion
less than the baseline amount. If those resources were
reduced by 1 percent annually from the current level (as
described in the third alternative), budget authority in
2021 would be $27 billion less than it would have been if
funding had grown with inflation since 2001.</p>

<p>One rationale for reducing discretionary spending is that
it has been growing faster than inflation and the size of
the economy, thereby diverting ever more resources from
the private sector, restraining economic growth, and contributing
to the increase in federal deficits and debt. Discretionary
outlays for programs other than DoD's averaged
3.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the
1990s and climbed to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2010; those
outlays would decline to between 2.4 percent and
2.9 percent of GDP in 2021 under the alternatives in this
option. Furthermore, some observers believe that many
programs spend money ineffectively and that there is little
relationship between expenditures and results; thus,
reductions could be made with little negative impact on
individuals or on the economy.
An argument against cutting non-DoD discretionary
funding is that it supports important programs such as
education, infrastructure, housing, and law enforcement,
among others. Providing those services to a growing
population could be difficult if spending declined to
historically low levels as a percentage of GDP, as it would
under the alternatives in this option. In the current
budget environment, state and local governments would
have difficulty compensating for reductions in federal
expenditures. Implementation could be challenging as
well; discretionary appropriations, which are comparable
in amount with DoD's appropriations, are widely distributed
among more than 100 agencies. Implementing well-
targeted cuts in those appropriations would therefore be
much more challenging than making such cuts in DoD's
spending.</p>
