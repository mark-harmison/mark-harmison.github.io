<div><a name="TAX3"></a><h1>Use an Alternative Measure of Inflation to Index Some Parameters of the Tax Code</h1>

<p>Several parameters of the tax code change every year with
the price of goods and services, as measured by the consumer
price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U).
Among the tax parameters that change are the amounts
of personal and dependent exemptions; the size of the
standard deductions; the income thresholds that divide
the rate brackets for the individual income tax; the
amount of annual gifts exempt from the gift tax; and the
thresholds and phaseout boundaries for the earned
income tax credit, the child tax credit, and several other
credits. Indexing is intended to keep those amounts relatively
stable in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.</p>

<p>Indexing is accomplished by adjusting each parameter
from its value in a base year by the percentage change in
the CPI-U between that base year and the most recent
year for which information is available. The period used
for the calculation is not a calendar year but the 12
months that elapse from September to August. The value
of the CPI-U in August becomes available in September,
which allows enough time to index the tax parameters
and prepare the necessary forms for the coming year.
Adjustments in parameters of the tax code are calculated
as follows: In the base year of 1987, for example, the standard
deduction for a single tax filer was $3,000. Between
1987 and 2010, the CPI-U increased by 93.9 percent;
correspondingly, the standard deduction (rounded to the
lowest $50 increment) increased to $5,800 for 2011.</p>

<p>The standard CPI-U, however, overstates changes in the
cost of living by not fully accounting for the extent to
which households substitute one product for another
when the relative prices of products change. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics created the chained CPI-U to explicitly
address that "substitution bias" in the standard CPI-U.
Whereas the standard CPI-U uses a basket of products
reflecting consumption patterns that are as much as two
years old, the chained CPI-U incorporates adjustments
that people make in the types of products they buy from
one month to the next. Although the chained CPI-U
corrects for the substitution bias in the standard CPI-U,
neither the chained nor the standard CPI-U perfectly
captures changes in the cost of living because neither fully
accounts for increases in the quality of existing products
or the value of new products.</p>

<p>This option would use the chained CPI-U instead of the
standard CPI-U to adjust various parameters of the tax
code. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the
chained CPI-U is likely to grow at an average annual rate
that is 0.25 percentage points less than the standard
CPI-U over the next decade. Therefore, using the
chained CPI-U to index tax parameters would increase
the amount of income subject to taxation and result in
higher tax revenues. Furthermore, the effects of instituting
such a policy would grow over time. The net revenue
increase would be about $700 million in 2012 but would
reach $14 billion in 2021. Net additional revenues would
total $17 billion over the 2012-2016 period and would
sum to $72 billion from 2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of using the chained CPI-U to
index tax parameters is that this approach would more
accurately adjust people's tax liability to reflect changes in
the cost of living than the standard CPI-U. The chained
CPI-U provides a better measure of changes in the cost of
living by more quickly capturing the extent to which
households adjust their consumption in response to
changes in relative prices.</p>

<p>An argument against implementing this option is that
only an initial estimate of the chained CPI-U is available
on a monthly basis; a final and more accurate estimate
is delayed because it is more complicated and time-
consuming to compute the chained CPI-U than it is to
compute the standard index. (The Congressional Budget
Office discussed the details of this approach in a Web-
only technical appendix released with its February 2010
issue brief Using a Different Measure of Inflation for Indexing
Federal Programs and the Tax Code.) At the start of
every year, all of the initial estimates for the prior year are
revised, and one year later those interim estimates are further
revised and made final. Because of those delays, the
initial and interim estimates of the chained CPI-U, which
typically contain errors, would need to be used to index
the parameters in the tax code. Since the chained CPI-U
was first published in 2002, however, the changes
between the initial and final values have been relatively
small. If the adjustment for each year was based on the
index value from an earlier base year, those small errors
would not accumulate beyond the current year. Furthermore,
because the initial and interim estimates of the
chained CPI-U have been closer to the final version of the
chained CPI-U than the existing CPI-U has been, those
estimates still reflect the basic improvement attributable
to the chained CPI-U.</p>
