<div><a name="TAX22"></a><h1>Extend the Period for Depreciating the Cost of Certain Investments</h1>

<p>When calculating their taxable income, companies can
deduct the expenses they incurred when producing goods
or services for sale, including depreciation (the drop in
the value of a productive asset over time). The tax code
sets the number of years over which the value of different
types of investments can be deducted from taxable
income.</p>

<p>This option would extend the lifetime of equipment and
certain structures placed into service after December 31,
2012, for purposes of tax depreciation. Specifically, where
the tax code currently stipulates a lifetime of 3, 5, 7, 10,
15, or 20 years, this option would raise the lifetime to
4, 8, 11, 20, 30, or 39 years, respectively.1 Those changes
would increase revenues by a total of $79 billion from
2012 through 2016 and by $241 billion over the 2012-
2021 period.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of this option is that the current
rates of tax depreciation overstate the decline in the
economic value of assets because they do not accurately
reflect the rate of inflation that is likely to occur over the
asset's lifetime. Because rates of depreciation are set by the
tax code and depreciation deductions are not indexed
for inflation, the real (inflation-adjusted) value of the
depreciation allowed by tax law depends on the rate of
inflation.</p>

<p>Most rates of depreciation in the tax code today were set
in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and would approximate
economic depreciation (the decline in an asset's economic
value, including the impact of inflation over time) if
the average rate of inflation had been 5 percent during
that 25-year period. The Congressional Budget Office
estimates, however, that inflation over the next decade
will average about 2 percent annually. That difference of
about 3 percentage points means businesses can deduct
larger amounts of depreciation from taxable income--
and thus have a lower tax liability--than they could if the
deduction accurately measured economic depreciation.</p>

<p>Another argument in favor of this option is that it would
equalize effective tax rates--the total amount of tax
liability divided by income--on the income from different
types of investment. Equipment and structures are
two of the main types of tangible capital for which businesses
take depreciation deductions, and the effective tax
rates are currently quite different. Deductions for equipment
generally contribute more to the understatement of
taxable income than do deductions for structures; equipment
has a shorter service life (the time over which depreciation
deductions can be taken), so changes in inflation
have a greater effect on deductions for equipment. Since
1986, policymakers have extended the useful lifetime of
some kinds of structures for calculating depreciation.</p>

<p>In contrast, recent legislation allows firms to accelerate
depreciation deductions for equipment. The Tax Relief,
Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job
Creation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-312) allows firms
to expense--that is, immediately deduct from taxable
income--100 percent of the costs of investment in
equipment made between September 8, 2010, and
December 31, 2011. For equipment acquired between
January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, firms will be
able to immediately deduct 50 percent of the cost. After
2012, current tax law will revert to the typical rules,
which allow no expensing (except in limited cases) and
generally require firms to deduct their equipment investment
over a number of years.</p>

<p>Under the law currently in effect for 2013, if inflation
remained at 2 percent and the real discount rate (which
adjusts for the change in the value of a dollar over time)
for businesses was 5 percent, the average effective tax
rates on income from corporate investment would be
25 percent for equipment and 30 percent for structures.
In contrast, under this option, those rates would be
33 percent for equipment and 32 percent for structures.
That near parity would mitigate the incentive that
exists in the tax code for companies to invest more in
equipment and less in structures than they might if
investment decisions were based on economic returns.
Such an incentive distorts choices between investing in
equipment and investing in structures, thus reducing
economic efficiency.</p>

<p>Those average tax rates would differ if inflation was
different, however. If the rate of inflation was a percentage
point lower, the average effective tax rate under
this option would be 30 percent for equipment and</p>

<p>31 percent for structures. Conversely, if inflation was
a percentage point higher, the rates for equipment
and structures would be 35 percent and 33 percent,
respectively. Therefore, if inflation differed from CBO's
expectations, new distortions between investment in
equipment and structures would emerge over the long
run.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that low tax rates on
capital may encourage investment. From that perspective,
the current tax treatment could be equalized by easing
taxation on all forms of capital rather than by raising the
effective tax rate on a type of capital that is now favored.
In addition, under this option, there would continue to
be substantial variation in the effective tax rates for equipment
with different service lives.</p>
