<div><a name="SPENDM32"></a><h1>Apply the Social Security Benefit Formula to Individual Years of Earnings</h1>

<p>A two-step process is used to calculate Social Security
benefits. First, a worker's average indexed monthly earnings,
or AIME, is computed. For a retired worker, the
AIME is calculated on the basis of the highest 35 years of
earnings on which Social Security taxes were paid, with
earnings included up to the taxable maximum, which in
2011 is $106,800. Earnings before age 60 are adjusted by
growth in the average wage index (AWI), which is the
average of all earnings in the U.S. economy; earnings
after age 59 enter the computations as actual amounts.
(As a result, for someone born in 1925 or later, earning
$10,000 in 1974 had the same effect on benefits as earning
$20,000 in 1984 because the AWI doubled over the
course of that period.) Second, a progressive benefit formula
is applied to the AIME to arrive at the primary
insurance amount (PIA), the sum that is payable each
month to a worker who begins receiving Social Security
retirement benefits at the full retirement age, currently
66. For workers who turn 66 in 2011, the PIA formula is
90 percent of the first $680 of the AIME, plus 32 percent
of the AIME between $680 and $4,100, plus 15 percent
of the AIME above $4,100.</p>

<p>Under the PIA formula, benefits replace a larger share of
average career earnings for people with lower earnings
than they do for people with higher earnings. For example,
the benefit for someone with very low earnings is
90 percent of that person's AIME, but the benefit for
someone with earnings above the taxable maximum for
35 years is about 28 percent of the AIME.</p>

<p>This option would essentially reverse the order of the
computation: A progressive benefit formula would be
applied to each year of indexed earnings, and the PIA
would be equal to the average of the annual PIAs. As
under current law, this option's benefit formula is progressive,
although it would apply that progressivity to
annual earnings rather than to lifetime earnings. The
change would reduce federal outlays by about $15 billion
over five years and by almost $89 billion through 2021.
By 2050, Social Security outlays would be reduced by
5 percent--from 5.9 percent to 5.6 percent of gross
domestic product.</p>

<p>Under this option, almost all workers' PIAs would be
lower than they are under current law, but the reduction
would be steeper for people whose earnings varied more
from year to year, including people who were out of the
workforce for many years. There would be no change in
benefits for a worker whose earnings were equal to (or a
constant proportion of) the AWI in every year of work.
But benefits would fall substantially for someone with
high earnings in some years and no earnings in others.
For example, compare the case of a "steady earner" who
has earnings equal to the AWI for 35 years or more with
the case of a "short-career worker" who earns the same
average wage when working but works for only 10 years.
Even though that worker has average earnings during
10 years of employment, his or her lifetime earnings are
quite low because of the 25 years of zero earnings. Under
current law, the progressive benefit formula is applied to
that low level of lifetime earnings (as measured by the
AIME), and the short-career worker's Social Security benefit
will replace almost 80 percent of his or her average
lifetime earnings. Under this option, the benefit formula
would be applied to the worker's average earnings while
working, and the progressive benefit formula would
replace just 45 percent of those earnings. Thus, this
option would have no effect on the steady earner, but it
would reduce the benefits of the short-career worker by
more than 40 percent.</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that it would encourage
some people to work longer, which would increase the
size of the workforce and boost federal revenues from
income and payroll taxes. Also, the additional work
would result in higher future Social Security benefits.
The 10-year estimates for this option do not include
those two effects.</p>

<p>When weighing the decision to retire, people may consider
how the timing of retirement will affect Social
Security benefits. Under current law, one additional year
of work by someone who had worked for fewer than
35 years would in most cases increase annual benefits by
32 percent or 15 percent of the year's earnings divided
by 35, because most workers have an AIME that is in the
32 percent or 15 percent bracket of the PIA formula.
Under this option, the worker's benefit would increase by
a larger amount, because at least part of the earnings in
that additional year would fall in the 90 percent bracket.
Consider a worker who worked 34 years at average wages.
Under current law, a 35th year of work would increase
annual benefits by about $375, but under this option it
would increase benefits by about $525.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that a worker's ability
to save for retirement depends on lifetime earnings, not
annual earnings. People with more volatile earnings histories,
who would experience the largest reductions in benefits,
tend to have low lifetime earnings. Benefits would
decline by about 15 percent, on average, for beneficiaries
in the lowest quintile--or fifth--of lifetime household
earnings. In contrast, benefits would fall by about 8 percent
for people in the second-lowest earnings quintile and
by 5 percent for groups with higher lifetime household
earnings.</p>
