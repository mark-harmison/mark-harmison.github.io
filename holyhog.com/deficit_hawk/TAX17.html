<div><a name="TAX17"></a><h1>Expand Social Security Coverage to Include Newly Hired State and Local Government Employees</h1>

<p>Unlike nearly all private-sector workers and federal
employees, some workers employed by state and local
governments--about 25 percent--are not covered by
Social Security. Under federal law, state and local governments
can opt to enroll their employees in the Social
Security program or they can opt out if they provide a
separate retirement plan for those workers instead. State
and local governments may also have their employees
participate in Social Security and be part of a separate
retirement plan. In contrast, all federal employees hired
after December 31, 1983, are covered by Social Security
and pay the associated payroll taxes. Furthermore,
all state and local government employees hired after
March 31, 1986, and all federal government employees
are covered by Medicare and pay taxes for Hospital
Insurance (Medicare Part A).</p>

<p>Under this option, Social Security coverage would be
expanded to include all state and local government
employees hired after December 31, 2011. Consequently,
all newly hired state and local government employees
would pay the Social Security payroll tax, which
funds the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
programs. In 2012 and thereafter, that tax will be
12.4 percent of earnings, half of which is deducted from
employees' paychecks and half of which is paid by
employers. (As a result of the Tax Relief, Unemployment
Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010
[Public Law 111-312], the share of the Social Security
tax that employees pay was reduced from 6.2 percent
of covered earnings to 4.2 percent for 2011 only.) If
implemented, this option would increase revenues by
$24 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by a total of
$96 billion over the 2012-2021 period. (The estimates
include the reduction in individual income tax revenues
that would result from a shift of some labor compensation
from a taxable to a nontaxable form.)
Paying the Social Security payroll tax for 10 years generally
qualifies workers (and their dependents) to receive
Social Security retirement benefits; other work requirements
must be met for employees to qualify for disability
benefits or, in the event of their death, for their dependents
to qualify for survivors' benefits. Although extending
such coverage to all newly hired state and local
employees would eventually increase the number of
Social Security beneficiaries, that increase would have
little impact on the federal government's spending for
Social Security in the short term. Over the 2012-2021
period, outlays would increase only by a small amount
because most people who would be hired by state and
local governments over that period would not begin
receiving Social Security benefits for many years. (The
estimates do not include any effects on outlays.)</p>

<p>In the long term, the additional benefit payments for the
expanded pool of beneficiaries would be only about half
the size of the additional revenues. That is largely because
most of the newly hired workers would receive Social
Security benefits anyway under current law for one of
two possible reasons: They may have held other covered
jobs in the past, or they were covered by a spouse's
employment. As a result, this option would slightly
enhance the long-term viability of the Social Security
program, which faces the prospect that income from
Social Security payroll taxes will not be sufficient to
finance the benefits that are due to beneficiaries under
current law.</p>

<p>Another rationale for the option concerns fairness. Social
Security benefits are intended to replace only a percentage
of a worker's pre-retirement earnings. That percentage
(referred to as the replacement rate) is higher for
workers with low career earnings than for workers with
higher earnings. But the standard formula for calculating
Social Security benefits does not distinguish between
people whose career earnings are low and those who just
appear to have low career earnings because they spent a
portion of their career working in jobs that were not covered
by Social Security. To make the replacement rate
more comparable for workers with similar earnings histories,
current law reduces the standard benefits for retired
government employees who have worked a substantial
portion of their career in employment that is not covered
by Social Security. However, that adjustment is imperfect
and can affect various public employees differently: specifically,
it can result in higher replacement rates for some
public employees who were not covered by Social Security
throughout their career and in lower replacement
rates for other public employees. This option would eliminate
the inequities of the current system.</p>

<p>Implementing this option would also provide better
retirement and disability benefits for many workers who
move between government jobs and other types of
employment. By facilitating job mobility, the option
would enable some workers--who would otherwise stay
in state and local jobs solely to maintain their public-
employee retirement benefits--to move to jobs in which
they could be more productive. Many state and local
employees are reluctant to leave their jobs because pensions
are structured to reward people who spend their
entire careers in the same pension system. If their government
service was covered by Social Security, there would
be fewer disincentives to moving because they would
remain in the Social Security system. State and local governments,
however, might respond to greater turnover by
reducing their investment in workers--by cutting training
programs, for example--causing the productivity of
state and local employees to decline.</p>

<p>An argument against such a policy change is that it might
place an added burden on some state and local governments,
which already face significant budgetary challenges.
State and local pension plans are generally
designed to be prefunded so that participants' contributions
can be invested to pay future benefits. As long as the
plans are fully funded, transferring new employees to the
Social Security system would not cause any problems.
However, many plans are underfunded and depend on
the contributions from new participants to make up the
shortfall. Under this option, the affected state and local
governments would probably restructure their plans in
one of two ways. First, they might exclude newly hired
state and local employees from participation--thereby
forgoing a possible source of new funding--which would
place an additional burden on those governments. Second,
they might choose to supplement the Social Security
coverage for new employees, but costs to state and local
governments would have to increase to provide an
equivalently valued benefit package that included Social
Security. Total costs would be higher because the cost per
dollar of Social Security benefits for state and local
government employees would probably exceed the cost
per dollar for pensions provided by state and local governments.
Social Security costs would be greater because
that program initially paid benefits to recipients who had
not contributed much to the system and because Social
Security redistributes benefits to workers with low career
earnings. Delaying implementation of the option for a
few years would provide state and local governments time
to restructure their pension plans. Nevertheless, costs to
the affected state and local governments would probably
rise.</p>
