<div><a name="SPENDD37"></a><h1>Reduce the Across-the-Board Adjustment for Federal Civilian Employees' Pay</h1>

<p>Under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of
1990 (FEPCA), most federal civilian employees receive
an annual adjustment to their pay each January. As specified
by that law, the size of the adjustment is set at the
annual rate of increase of the employment cost index
(ECI) for wages and salaries minus one-half of a percentage
point.1 The across-the-board increase as spelled out
under FEPCA, however, does not always occur. For
example, the President can limit the size of the increase if
he determines that a national emergency exists or that
serious economic conditions call for such action. (Similarly,
the Congress can authorize an adjustment that differs
from the one sought by the President.) Legislation
forgoing across-the-board adjustments for 2011 and
2012 was recently enacted in the Continuing Appropriations
and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011
(Public Law 111-322).</p>

<p>Under this option, the annual across-the-board adjustment
that would be expected to occur under FEPCA
would be reduced by 0.5 percentage points each year
from 2013 through 2021. Under such a scenario, federal
civilian salaries (as well as benefits directly tied to salaries)
would not be affected in 2011 and 2012 because the
annual pay adjustment has already been canceled for
those years. Assuming that appropriations were reduced
by a commensurate amount, federal outlays would be
reduced by almost $10 billion over 5 years and by
$50 billion over 10 years.</p>

<p>One rationale for this option is that compensation costs
for federal civilian employees make up roughly 15 percent
of federal discretionary spending, and therefore any
significant reduction in that category of spending would
require that personnel costs be constrained. In addition,
it would signal that the federal government and its workers
were sharing in the sacrifices that many beneficiaries
of federal programs may be asked to make in the name of
deficit reduction. Similarly, it would demonstrate that
federal workers have not been shielded from the impacts
of the economic downturn, which has resulted in large
numbers of workers in the private sector either losing
their job or having their wages remain flat or decline.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that it would make
it more difficult for the federal government to recruit
qualified employees. That effect might be pronounced
for federal agencies that require workers with advanced
degrees and professional skills. Recent research suggests
that although federal workers with less education are
paid more than private-sector workers with comparable
characteristics, federal workers with professional and
advanced degrees are paid less than comparable workers
in the private sector. Thus, lower across-the-board
increases in federal pay might bring federal and private
pay closer to parity for less educated workers but at the
same time widen the gap between federal employees and
private-sector employees working in jobs that require
high levels of education. For federal employees who are
eligible to retire but have not done so, such action could
also reduce their incentive to continue working. If a significant
number of those workers decided to retire as a
result of smaller increases in pay, increased retirement
costs could offset some of the payroll savings produced by
the policy change.</p>
