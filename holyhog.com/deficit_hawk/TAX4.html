<div><a name="TAX4"></a><h1>Gradually Eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction</h1>

<p>The tax code treats investments in owner-occupied housing
more favorably than it does other investments. For
example, the owner of a rental house can deduct various
expenses, such as mortgage interest, property taxes,
depreciation, and maintenance, but has to pay taxes on
the rental income--net of those expenses--and on any
capital gain when the house is sold. In contrast, homeowners
can deduct mortgage interest and property taxes
from their income when they compute their income tax
liability, even though they do not have to pay tax on the
net rental value of their home. (Other housing-related
expenses cannot be deducted from homeowners'
income.) Homeowners also can exclude from taxation
capital gains of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for joint filers)
when they sell their primary residence.</p>

<p>Current law limits the total amount of mortgage debt
that can be included in the calculation of an interest
deduction to $1.1 million: $1 million for debt that a
homeowner incurs to buy, build, or improve a first or second
home; and as much as $100,000 in other debt (such
as a home-equity loan) for which the owner uses the
home as security, regardless of the purpose of that loan.</p>

<p>Beginning in 2013, with the expiration of the Tax Relief,
Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job
Creation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-312), the total
value of certain itemized deductions--including the
mortgage interest deduction--will be reduced if the
taxpayer's adjusted gross income is above a specified
threshold.</p>

<p>This option would phase out the mortgage interest
deduction, beginning in 2014. By that time, the
Congressional Budget Office forecasts, foreclosures
will have subsided, construction will have returned to
normal levels, and housing prices will have begun to
recover. The option would reduce the maximum mortgage
eligible for the interest deduction from $1.1 million
in 2013 to zero in 2024 in annual increments of
$100,000. That change would boost revenues by only
$14 billion from 2012 through 2016 but by $215 billion
through 2021 and by increasing amounts relative to the
size of the economy through 2024.</p>

<p>One argument in favor of the option is that it would
improve the allocation of resources in the economy. The
current deduction encourages home buyers who can
itemize deductions to buy houses when they might otherwise
rent or, especially, to buy bigger houses than they
would buy if all investments were taxed equally. As a
result, it is argued, homeowners invest too much in their
houses and too little elsewhere. Reducing the maximum
amount of mortgage debt on which interest could be
deducted--and then eliminating that deduction
entirely--should make many people more willing to
invest in stocks, bonds, savings accounts, or their own
businesses rather than in housing. Between 1950 and
2009, about 36 percent of net private domestic investment
went into owner-occupied housing. That share is
large enough that a reduction in investment in owner-
occupied housing could eventually boost the amount of
capital available to other sectors of the economy and
increase total economic output.</p>

<p>Another argument in favor of this option is that eliminating
the mortgage interest deduction would curtail the tax
advantage for homeowners who borrow against their
homes to buy other goods or to fund tax-favored retirement
savings accounts, such as 401(k) plans and individual
retirement accounts. Allowing homeowners to deduct
interest for loans used to finance other consumption
distorts their choices between saving and consuming and
probably reduces national saving. The deduction also
favors owners over renters, who cannot deduct interest on
normal consumer loans (such as automobile loans or
credit card debt). Furthermore, allowing homeowners to
deduct interest on mortgage loans at the same time that
they contribute to tax-favored savings plans enables
homeowners to take advantage of tax savings on both
transactions. It thus provides an incentive for people to
pay down mortgage debt more slowly and contribute
more to retirement accounts than they would if mortgage
interest was not deductible. Such transactions reduce
federal tax revenues without increasing net saving because
the higher retirement contributions are offset by larger
amounts of outstanding mortgage debt.</p>

<p>A drawback of eliminating the deductibility of mortgage
interest is that it could delay the recovery of home values,
home construction, and home mortgage lending from
their currently depressed levels. Even though the option
would not take effect until 2014 and would be implemented
gradually over a 10-year period, housing markets
might begin to feel the effects sooner, as buyers anticipated
the reduction--and eventual elimination--of the
mortgage interest deduction. That would create new
hardships, in addition to those already plaguing the housing
market, for people who own homes (particularly
those currently "under water" because they owe more on
their mortgage than the house is worth), home builders,
and lenders.</p>

<p>Another drawback is that this option might adversely
affect individuals and their communities by reducing the
rate of home ownership, particularly among younger and
less wealthy people who must borrow in order to buy.
Owning a home has been found to increase people's
involvement in their community and local government.
Moreover, it motivates people to better maintain their
property, which benefits their neighbors as well as themselves.
Even though such actions benefit communities,
individuals typically do not consider those benefits when
deciding whether to rent or own a home. Subsidies to
encourage home ownership might offset that omission.</p>

<p>Although some incentive to become a homeowner may
benefit communities, the mortgage interest deduction
may be ineffective in that capacity. Despite the favorable
tax treatment that mortgage interest receives in the
United States, the rate of home ownership here is similar
to that in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom,
and none of those countries currently offers a tax deduction
for mortgage interest. The effect of the deduction on
people's decisions about whether to buy a house may be
small because lower-income people--who face the greatest
challenges in their efforts to become homeowners--
get the least benefit from the deduction. There are two
reasons for that disparity. First, lower-income people may
not have sufficient deductions to make itemizing worthwhile.
Second, the value of an itemized deduction is
greater for people in higher income tax brackets and with
larger mortgages.</p>
