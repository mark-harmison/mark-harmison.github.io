<div><a name="TAX7"></a><h1>Limit the Tax Benefit of Itemized Deductions to 15 Percent</h1>

<p>When preparing their returns, taxpayers may choose the
standard deduction or they may itemize and deduct certain
expenses (including state and local taxes, mortgage
interest, charitable contributions, and some medical
expenses) to determine their taxable income. Taxpayers
benefit from itemizing when their itemized deductions
exceed the amount of the standard deduction. For some
types of expenses (such as medical expenses), only the
amount that exceeds a given percentage of the taxpayer's
adjusted gross income may be deducted. Beginning in
2013, with the expiration of the Tax Relief, Unemployment
Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of
2010 (Public Law 111-312), the total value of certain
itemized deductions will be reduced if the taxpayer's
adjusted gross income is above a specified threshold.</p>

<p>As with any deduction, the benefit of itemizing increases
with a taxpayer's marginal tax rate (the rate that applies to
the last dollar of income). For instance, $10,000 in
deductions reduces tax liability by $1,500 for someone in
the 15 percent tax bracket but by $2,800 for someone in
the 28 percent tax bracket.</p>

<p>This option would limit the extent to which taxes can
be reduced by itemizing to 15 percent of the deductions'
value, thus increasing revenues by $460 billion from
2012 through 2016 and by $1,181 billion over 10 years.
It would raise taxes for people in marginal tax brackets
above 15 percent who itemize deductions. Most taxpayers,
however, do not itemize deductions. Among the
36 percent who do, about 75 percent receive a tax benefit
from itemizing that is worth more than 15 percent of
their deductions. Thus, the option would affect about
one out of four taxpayers.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of the option is that the current
rules for itemizing deductions lead to too much spending
on tax-favored activities because they effectively reduce
the after-tax price of such activities. For example, the
deduction for mortgage interest may cause homeowners
to invest too much in their houses and too little elsewhere.
From that perspective, reducing the benefit
derived from itemizing deductions would lessen the
incentive to spend money on deductible activities. That
could improve the allocation of society's resources in cases
in which the current subsidy has led to too much spending
on those activities. But some deductions are intended
to subsidize activities that have widespread benefits to the
public, such as the work of charitable organizations;
under certain circumstances, curtailing those deductions
could worsen the allocation of resources.</p>

<p>Another argument in favor of the option concerns equity.
The current system provides a greater tax reduction per
dollar of deductible expense to higher-income taxpayers
than to those with lower income. By weakening the link
between deductible expenses and a household's marginal
tax bracket, the option would subsidize those expenses
more equitably among households with different
incomes. Weakening that link could also reduce the
extent to which resources are misallocated. For a given
amount of subsidies, a system of uniform subsidies generally
distorts taxpayer behavior less than does a system in
which subsidies are large for some households and small
for others.</p>

<p>However, in cases in which higher-income taxpayers
are more sensitive than lower-income taxpayers to the
after-tax price of a subsidized activity that has widespread
benefits to society, eliminating the link between deductions
and a household's marginal tax bracket could
worsen economic efficiency by reducing the amount of
resources those taxpayers allocate to such activities.</p>

<p>An argument against the option is that some deductions
are intended to yield a measure of taxable income that
more accurately reflects a person's ability to pay taxes. For
example, taxpayers with large medical expenses or casualty
and theft losses may have fewer resources than taxpayers
with similar income and smaller expenses. Under
this option, taxpayers subject to the limitation would not
have those expenses fully subtracted from their taxable
income.</p>

<p>Limiting the tax benefit of itemized deductions would
alter relative tax burdens. Reducing the benefit from
itemized deductions would raise average tax rates more
for upper-income taxpayers than for those with lower
incomes. It would also raise average tax rates more
for people who incurred large deductible expenses than
for those with smaller expenses.</p>
