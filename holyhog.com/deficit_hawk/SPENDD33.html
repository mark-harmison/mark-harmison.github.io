<div><a name="SPENDD33"></a><h1>Reduce or Constrain Funding for the National Institutes of Health</h1>

<p>The budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
has grown significantly over the past 15 years, primarily
because of the large increases in NIH's appropriations (or
budget authority) during the 1998-2003 period, when
funding nearly doubled. In addition, NIH received
$10 billion in supplemental funding provided in the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(ARRA, Public Law 111-5). In 2010, over half of all
nondefense discretionary spending for health research
and development went to NIH.</p>

<p>This option presents two alternatives that would reduce
NIH's appropriations relative to the amounts in the baseline
budget projections of the Congressional Budget
Office. One alternative would restrict the rate of growth
in appropriations to 1 percent per year. That alternative
would reduce projected appropriations by about $2 billion
over 5 years and by about $13 billion over 10 years,
thereby reducing federal outlays by about $1 billion and
about $10 billion, respectively. The other alternative
would reduce NIH's fiscal year 2012 appropriation to the
amount provided in 2003, the last year in which NIH
had a large increase in its appropriation; after that, funding
would grow at the rate of inflation assumed in CBO's
baseline projections. Such a one-time cut of about 13 percent
would reduce projected appropriations by about
$20 billion over 5 years and about $43 billion over
10 years, thus cutting federal outlays by about $16 billion
and $38 billion, respectively.</p>

<p>An argument in support of this option is that such reductions
would encourage increased efficiencies throughout
NIH and more careful focus on priorities that will
provide the greatest benefits. NIH has 27 institutes and
centers that fund research across a wide array of health-
related topics. In addition, it supports more than
300,000 scientists and research personnel affiliated with
more than 3,100 organizations worldwide. Furthermore,
spending by NIH nearly tripled from 1997 to 2010.
With such a broad range of personnel and activities and a
large increase in funding, inefficiencies and duplicative or
wasteful efforts are likely. In a 2009 report (GAO-09687),
the Government Accountability Office "found gaps
in NIH's ability to monitor key aspects of its extramural
funding process." Thus, some costs could probably be
reduced or eliminated without harming high-priority
research.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that more than
80 percent of NIH's funding supports extramural
research activities (research that is not conducted by NIH
staff or on the main NIH campus) that are critical to
improving the nation's health care, which accounts for a
large and growing share of the economy. Reducing NIH's
funding would probably result in decreased support for
extramural research. Because NIH is a major source of
funding for academic biomedical research, deep cuts to
its budget could disrupt funding for programs already
under way. Furthermore, while having more focused priorities
is beneficial, it is difficult to know in advance
which projects will yield the most useful results. As a
result, large cuts to the NIH budget could discourage
innovation in agency-supported medical technologies
that have the potential to improve people's health.</p>
