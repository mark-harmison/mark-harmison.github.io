<div><a name="SPENDM1"></a><h1>Introduce Minimum Out-of-Pocket Requirements Under TRICARE For Life</h1>

<p>TRICARE For Life (TFL) was introduced in 2002 as a
supplement to Medicare for military retirees and their
family members who are eligible for Medicare. The program
pays nearly all medical costs for acute care not covered
by Medicare and requires few out-of-pocket fees.
Because the Department of Defense (DoD) is a passive
payer in the program--it neither manages care nor provides
incentives for the cost-conscious use of services--
it has virtually no means of controlling the program's
costs. In contrast, most public and private programs that
pay for health care either manage the care or require people
receiving care to pay deductibles or copayments to a
specified threshold. In 2010, DoD spent about $8.4 billion
on Medicare-eligible beneficiaries (in addition to
amounts spent for those individuals by Medicare).</p>

<p>This option would introduce minimum out-of-pocket
requirements for TFL beneficiaries. For calendar year
2013, TFL would not cover any of the first $550 of an
enrollee's cost-sharing payments under Medicare and
would cover only 50 percent of the next $4,950 in such
payments. (Because all further cost sharing would be covered
by TFL, enrollees would not be obliged to pay more
than $3,025 in cost sharing in that year.) Those dollar
limits would be indexed to growth in average Medicare
costs for later years. Currently, military treatment facilities
charge very small or no copayments for hospital
services to TFL beneficiaries. To reduce beneficiaries'
incentive to switch to those facilities and avoid the out-
of-pocket costs of using civilian facilities, this option
would require TFL beneficiaries seeking care from military
treatment facilities to make payments that would be
roughly comparable to the charges they would face at
civilian facilities.</p>

<p>This option would reduce spending for Medicare as well
as for TFL because higher out-of-pocket costs would lead
beneficiaries to use somewhat fewer medical services.
Altogether, this option would reduce the federal spending
devoted to TFL beneficiaries by about $15 billion
through 2016 and by about $43 billion through 2021.
Approximately 30 percent of those savings would come
from a reduced demand for medical services; the rest represents
a shift of spending from the government to military
retirees and their families.</p>

<p>An advantage of this option is that greater cost sharing
would increase TFL beneficiaries' awareness of the cost of
health care and promote a corresponding restraint in
their use of medical services. Research has generally
shown that introducing modest cost sharing can reduce
medical expenditures without causing measurable
increases in adverse health outcomes for most people.</p>

<p>Among its disadvantages, this option could discourage
some patients (particularly low-income patients) from
seeking preventive medical care or from managing their
chronic conditions under close medical supervision,
which might negatively affect their health.</p>
