<div><a name="TAX24"></a><h1>Eliminate the Source-Rules Exception for Exports</h1>

<p>To prevent the income that U.S. corporations earn
abroad from being subject to both foreign and U.S. taxation,
the federal government provides a credit that
reduces those companies' domestic tax liability by the
amount of income and withholding taxes they have paid
to foreign governments. Under the rules governing that
foreign tax credit, it cannot exceed the amount of U.S.
tax those businesses otherwise would have owed, nor can
it be used to reduce taxes on the income they earned in
the United States. If a corporation pays more foreign tax
on its foreign income than it otherwise would have paid
on identical domestic income, it accrues what is known as
excess foreign tax credits under the U.S. tax code.</p>

<p>Unlike income from overseas operations, income from
goods that are produced domestically but sold abroad
results almost entirely from the value created or added in
the United States. Hence, the income that U.S. corporations
receive from exports typically is not taxed by foreign
nations. But, according to the tax code, if a firm produces
its goods within the United States and then sells its inventory
abroad as exports, only half of the income is allocated
to the United States; the other half is governed by
the U.S. tax code's "title passage rule" and allocated to the
jurisdiction in which the sale took place. (The title passage
rule specifies that, when a firm's inventory is sold,
the income from that sale is treated as earned in the country
in which the sale occurred--and is subject to that
country's tax laws.) In practice, if the company's inventory
is produced in the United States and sold elsewhere,
half of the income from those sales is treated as originating
abroad, even if the company has no branch or subsidiary
located in the place of sale and the foreign jurisdiction
does not tax the income.</p>

<p>The result is that a business can classify more of its
income from exports as foreign than could be justified
solely on the basis of where the underlying economic
activity occurred. A multinational corporation can then
use any excess foreign tax credits to offset U.S. taxes on
that income. About half of the export income that companies
with such excess credits receive is effectively
exempted from U.S. taxation, and the income allocation
rules give those companies an incentive to produce goods
domestically for sale by their overseas subsidiaries.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate the title passage rule and
require taxpayers to allocate income for the purpose of
taxation on the basis of where the economic activity actually
occurs. That change would increase revenues by
$21 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by $54 billion
over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>One rationale in favor of the option is that export incentives,
such as those embodied in the title passage rule,
do not boost domestic investment and employment overall
or affect the trade balance. They do increase profits--
and thus investment and employment--in industries that
sell substantial amounts of their products abroad. However,
the value of the U.S. dollar is boosted as a result,
making foreign goods cheaper and thereby reducing profits,
investment, and employment for U.S. companies
whose products compete with imported goods. Thus,
export incentives distort the allocation of resources by
misaligning the prices of goods relative to their production
costs, regardless of where the goods are produced.</p>

<p>This option also would end a feature of U.S. tax law
that allows businesses to avoid taxes on certain types of
income earned abroad. Foreign tax credits were intended
to prevent the income of U.S. businesses from being
taxed twice. But the title passage rule allows domestic
export income that is not usually subject to foreign taxes
to be exempted from U.S. taxes as well, so the income
escapes corporate taxation altogether.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that the title passage
rule gives U.S. corporations an advantage over foreign
companies operating in the same markets. (However,
enterprises that lack excess foreign tax credits--such as
some U.S. multinationals and U.S. exporters that carry
out all of their production domestically--receive no such complicated than doing so under the normal rules for
advantage.) Some opponents of this option also argue income allocation.
that allocating income under the title passage rule is less</p>
