<p>The Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve
Program (CRP) is intended to promote soil conservation,
improve water quality, and protect wildlife habitat by
removing land from active agricultural production. Landowners
sign contracts with the Department of Agriculture
to keep land out of production--usually for 10 to
15 years; in exchange, the department provides annual
payments and cost-sharing grants to establish appropriate
conservation practices on land enrolled in the program.
Acreage may be added to the CRP through general
enrollments, which are held periodically for larger tracts
of land, or through continuous enrollments, which are
available at any time during the year for smaller tracts of
land. An example of an effective type of acreage for those
purposes is conservation buffers--narrow strips of land
that are maintained in permanent vegetation and are
designed to intercept pollutants, reduce erosion, and provide
other environmental benefits. Acreage is accepted
into the CRP on the basis of an evaluation of the costs
and potential environmental benefits of a landowner's
plan for the land. Under current law, total enrollment is
capped at 32 million acres, and about 31 million acres are
enrolled. The Department of Agriculture spends about
$2.4 billion per year on the CRP.</p>

<p>Prohibiting new general enrollments (including reenrollments),
beginning in 2012, would reduce spending by
$3 billion over the 2012-2016 period, the Congressional
Budget Office estimates, and by about $9 billion over the
2012-2021 period. Under this approach, the amount of
land enrolled in the CRP would drop significantly, to
11.9 million acres by 2021.
Although there is widespread agreement about the need
to take some environmentally sensitive land out of production,
an advantage of scaling back the CRP is that the
land could become available for other uses that would
provide greater environmental benefits. Another advantage
of limiting the program could be that retiring less
cropland in a given area might enhance economic activity
(for example, by increasing the demand for seed, fertilizer,
and other farm supplies), thus helping rural communities.
Also, reducing CRP enrollment could free more
land to produce crops and biomass needed for renewable
energy products.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of scaling back the CRP could be that the
Department of Agriculture's existing plan to accept only
the most environmentally sensitive land in future enrollments
might turn out to be a cost-effective way to protect
fragile lands. Studies have indicated that the CRP yields
high returns--in enhanced wildlife habitat, improved
water quality, and reduced soil erosion--for every dollar
it spends.</p>
