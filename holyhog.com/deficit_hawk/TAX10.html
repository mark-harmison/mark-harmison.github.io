<p>Investment funds--such as private equity, real estate, and
hedge funds--are typically organized as partnerships with
one or more general partners managing the fund. The
general partners determine investment strategy; solicit
capital contributions; acquire, manage, and sell assets;
arrange loans; and provide administrative support for all
of those activities. Such partnerships also typically
include limited partners, who contribute capital to the
partnership but do not participate in the fund's management.
General partners can invest their own financial
capital in the partnership, but such investments usually
represent a small share of the total funds invested.</p>

<p>General partners typically receive two types of compensation
for managing a fund: a fee tied to some percentage of
the fund's assets under management; and a profit share,
or "carried interest," tied to some percentage of the profits
generated by the fund. A common compensation
agreement gives general partners a 2 percent fee and
20 percent in carried interest. The fee, less the fund's
expenses, is taxed as ordinary income (and thus is subject
to regular income tax rates). In contrast, the carried interest
that general partners receive is taxed in the same way
as the investment income passed through to the limited
partners. For example, if that investment income consists
solely of capital gains, the carried interest is taxed only
when those gains are realized and at the lower capital
gains rate. Until 2013, the general partners' share of dividends
is also taxed at the lower rate.</p>

<p>This option would treat the carried interest that partners
receive for performing investment management services
as ordinary income. Income those partners received as a
return on their own capital contribution would not be
affected. The change would produce $10 billion in revenues
from 2012 through 2016 and $21 billion from
2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>Arguments in favor of this option reflect the view that
carried interest should be considered performance-based
compensation for management services rather than a
return on the financial capital invested by the general
partner. In accordance with that viewpoint, the option
would eliminate two notable differences in the way
carried interest and comparable forms of income are
currently taxed. First, taxing carried interest as ordinary
income would make its treatment consistent with that
applied to many other forms of performance-based
compensation, such as bonuses and most stock options.
Second, the option would equalize the tax treatment of
income that partners receive for performing investment
management services and the treatment of income earned
by corporate executives who do similar work. (The managers
of publicly traded mutual funds, for example, also
invest in a variety of assets. And the executives of many
corporations direct investment, arrange financing, purchase
other companies, or spin off components of their
enterprises.)</p>

<p>Arguments against the option reflect the view that at least
a portion of carried interest represents a return on the
financial capital invested by the general partner. From
that perspective, carried interest is the equivalent of an
interest-free nonrecourse loan from the limited partners
to the general partner. That loan is equal to the agreed-
upon share of the partnership's assets (commonly 20 percent),
with the requirement that the loan proceeds be
reinvested in the fund. (A borrower is not personally liable
for a nonrecourse loan beyond the pledged collateral,
which in this case would be the general partner's claim on
future profits.) When the partnership sells its assets, it is
argued, any gain realized or loss incurred by the general
partner on his or her share (after the loan was paid back)
could be legitimately viewed as a capital gain or loss.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this option would treat the income of partners
who provide investment management services differently
from that earned by entrepreneurs who start a new
business, contribute both labor services and capital, and
then sell the business. Profits from such sales generally are
taxed as capital gains, even though some of those profits
represent a direct return on specific labor services provided
by the owners.</p>

<p>Another argument against such a policy change is that,
if at least a portion of carried interest is presumed to be
a return on the general partner's investment, it would
reduce the incentive for general partners to undertake
risky investments that can lead to innovation, new products,
and more-efficient markets and businesses. It is not
clear, however, to what extent a lower rate on capital gains
contributes to such outcomes, or even whether promoting
risky investment offers more economic advantages
than disadvantages.</p>

<p>An alternative option, which presupposes that carried
interest is neither entirely a return on capital nor entirely
labor compensation, would explicitly recognize carried
interest as an interest-free nonrecourse loan from the
limited partners to the general partner. Under current tax
rules, the implicit interest on that (nominally interest-
free) loan would be determined by the interest rate on
federal securities with the same duration and would be
taxed as ordinary income. At the time the partnership
sold its assets, any gains realized or losses incurred by the
general partner (after the loan was repaid) would be
treated as a capital gain or loss. The general partner
would typically pay more in taxes than is assessed under
current law but less than would be assessed if all carried
interest was treated as ordinary income.</p>

<p>An advantage of the alternative option is that it would
apply full taxation to at least some performance-based
compensation without changing the underlying
economics of the partnership arrangement. However,
the approach is complex, which could make it particularly
difficult to implement.</p>
