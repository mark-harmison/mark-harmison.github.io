<div><a name="SPENDM27"></a><h1>Base Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustments on an Alternative Measure of Inflation</h1>

<p>As specified by law, the Social Security Administration
increases recipients' monthly benefits in most years. For
example, the 5.8 percent cost-of-living adjustment
(COLA) that went into effect in January 2009 was based
on the increase in the consumer price index for urban
wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) between the
third quarters of 2007 and 2008. That index is calculated
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS. Although
declines in overall consumer prices between the third
quarters of 2008 and 2010 meant no COLAs were provided
in 2010 or 2011, the Congressional Budget Office
projects that there will be one in 2012.</p>

<p>The CPI-W, however, tends to overstate inflation because
it does not fully account for changes in patterns of spending.
This option would set the COLA equal to the
growth in the chained consumer price index for all urban
consumers (chained CPI-U). The chained CPI-U is an
alternative measure of inflation, also calculated by BLS,
that more fully incorporates the effects of changes in patterns
of spending. CBO estimates that, on average, the
chained CPI-U is likely to grow 0.25 percentage points
per year more slowly than the CPI-W over the next
10 years. Using the chained CPI-U to set Social Security
COLAs would reduce federal outlays by about $27 billion
over five years and by $112 billion through 2021,
CBO estimates. By 2050, such action would have
reduced Social Security outlays by 3 percent--from
5.9 percent to 5.7 percent of gross domestic product.
Some other policy changes that would reduce Social
Security outlays--by constraining the increase in initial
benefits, for example, or by raising the full retirement age
(Mandatory Spending--Options 28 and 30, respectively)--
would affect future beneficiaries only. This
option, by contrast, would reduce benefits to current
beneficiaries so that current and future generations would
bear the reductions more equally.</p>

<p>The chained CPI-U is initially published as a preliminary
value and then revised over the following two years. As a
result, implementing this option would require the use of
preliminary data. CBO discussed the details of the
approach in a Web-only technical appendix released with
its February 2010 issue brief, Using a Different Measure of
Inflation for Indexing Federal Programs and the Tax Code.</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that the CPI-W overstates
increases in the cost of living. Specifically, the CPI-W
measures inflation on the basis of price changes for a fixed
basket of goods and services that is periodically updated,
whereas the chained CPI-U more quickly captures the
extent to which households adjust their consumption
when relative prices change. (Technically, the chained
CPI-U avoids the so-called "substitution bias" that arises
from the use of a fixed basket of goods in computing the
CPI-W. Some analysts also conclude that neither the
CPI-W nor the chained CPI-U fully accounts for
increases in the quality of existing products or the value
of new products.) Therefore, using the chained CPI-U
would reduce federal outlays but ensure that, after adjusting
for overall inflation, benefits remain at the same level
as they are when a recipient becomes eligible for benefits.</p>

<p>An argument against reducing the COLA is that the
prices faced by Social Security beneficiaries could rise
faster than prices faced by the population at large. For
example, beneficiaries are likely to spend more than
younger people do for medical care, the price of which
generally outpaces the prices of many other goods and
services. BLS computes an experimental consumer price
index for the elderly (the CPI-E) that aims to track inflation
for the population ages 62 and older. From December
1982 through December 2010, the CPI-E grew faster
than the CPI-W by an average of 0.27 percentage points
per year. Another potential drawback of this option is
that a reduction in the COLA would generally have larger
effects on the oldest beneficiaries and on those who
initially became eligible for Social Security on the basis of
a disability. For example, if benefits were adjusted every tect vulnerable populations, lawmakers might choose to
year by 0.25 percentage points less than the increase in reduce the COLA only for beneficiaries whose income or
the CPI-W, beneficiaries would face a reduction in retire-benefits were greater than specified amounts. Doing so,
ment benefits at age 75 of about 3 percent compared with however, would reduce the budgetary savings from the
what they would receive under current law; at age 95, option.
they would face a reduction of about 8 percent. To pro-</p>
