<div><a name="TAX19"></a><h1>Set the Corporate Income Tax Rate at 35 Percent for All Corporations</h1>

<p>Most corporations subject to the corporate income tax
calculate their tax liability according to a progressive
rate schedule. That tax is assessed at the following
rates: 15 percent for the first $50,000 of taxable income;
25 percent for income from $50,000 to $75,000;
34 percent for income from $75,000 to $10 million;
and 35 percent for income above $10 million.</p>

<p>This option would set a single statutory rate of 35 percent
for all corporate taxable income, increasing revenues by
$12 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by $24 billion
from 2012 through 2021.</p>

<p>Under current law, surtaxes are imposed on some
amounts of corporate income. Income between $100,000
and $335,000 is subject to a surtax of 5 percent (increasing
the tax rate on income in that range from 34 percent
to 39 percent), and an additional 3 percent tax is levied
on income between $15 million and $18.3 million
(increasing the tax rate on income in that range from
35 percent to 38 percent). Those taxes effectively phase
out the benefit of the three lower tax rates for corporations
with income above certain amounts. As a result, a
company that reports more than $18.3 million in taxable
income effectively faces a statutory tax rate equal to
35 percent of its total corporate taxable income.1 Because
the surtaxes would also be eliminated, this option would
not alter the taxes those businesses pay, nor would it
affect businesses that operate as S corporations or as limited
liability companies. (Owners of those enterprises do
not pay corporate taxes but instead pay taxes on their
total business income under the individual income tax.)</p>

<p>A primary benefit of the progressive rate schedule for
the corporate income tax is that it lessens the "double
taxation" of profits earned by small and medium-sized
companies. Double taxation occurs when the government
taxes the earnings of C corporations once at the corporate
level and again at the individual level when those earnings
are distributed to households. Of the 500,000 to 1 million
corporations that typically owe corporate income
taxes each year, all but a few thousand pay only the lower
rates that apply to lower amounts of income. (Because the
companies that benefit earn only about 10 percent to
15 percent of all taxable corporate income, however, the
reduced rates have a limited effect on tax revenues.)</p>

<p>One argument for creating a flat corporate income tax is
that many of the companies that benefit from the current
rate structure are not small or medium-sized. Under
current law, large corporations can reduce their taxable
income for certain years by sheltering some of it or by
controlling when they earn income and incur expenses.
Another argument is that the current rate structure creates
opportunities for individuals to shelter income in
closely held corporations (that is, corporations whose
shares are held by one individual or a closely knit group
of shareholders and whose shares are not publicly traded).
People avoid paying individual income taxes on that
income if the corporation retains the earnings--which
may be taxed at the lower corporate rates--rather than
paying them out as dividends. (That benefit does not
apply to owners of personal-services corporations--such
as physicians, attorneys, and consultants--whose companies
are already taxed at a flat rate of 35 percent.)</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that it would reduce
the amount the affected companies would invest and
distort the way in which those businesses finance their
remaining investments. Investment capital would be
more costly for businesses affected by the higher tax rates.
Consequently, instead of issuing as much stock, those
companies would either increase their use of debt financing
(because the interest is tax-deductible) or decrease the
amounts they invest. Carrying more debt would increase
some companies' risk of default.</p>
