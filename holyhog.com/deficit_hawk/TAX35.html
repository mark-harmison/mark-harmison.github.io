<div><a name="TAX35"></a><h1>Impose a Price on Emissions of Greenhouse Gases</h1>

<p>The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere--
particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) released as a
result of deforestation and the use of fossil fuels--could
create costly changes in regional climates throughout the
world. The damage could include water shortages, the
loss of land in coastal areas because of rising sea levels,
acidification of the world's oceans, and the extinction of
various species. Concern about such damage has led policymakers
and analysts to consider policies designed to
reduce emissions of those gases.</p>

<p>Greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by requiring
emitters of large amounts to pay a price to emit those
gases. Such a policy could be instituted as a tax on emissions
or as part of a cap-and-trade system. In either case,
the cost of producing and consuming goods and services
would increase in proportion to the amount of greenhouse
gases emitted as a result of that production and
consumption. Ultimately, those costs would be passed on
to consumers in the form of higher prices. Those higher
prices, in turn, would create incentives throughout the
U.S. economy to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
This option would establish a cap-and-trade program
governing emissions of greenhouse gases in the United
States. Emissions would be measured in CO2 equivalents
(CO2e)--that is, the amount of carbon dioxide that
would cause an equivalent amount of warming. Under
such a program, a decreasing number of allowances--
which would convey the right to emit 1 metric ton of
CO2e apiece--would be sold at open auction, beginning
in 2012 and ending in 2050. According to estimates by
the Congressional Budget Office, emissions from the sectors
that were subject to the cap-and-trade policy would
fall by roughly 20 percent from their projected amounts
in 2025 and by 50 percent from their projected amounts
in 2050. Firms would be allowed to shift their use of
allowances from one year to another by "banking"
unused allowances or by "borrowing" allowances from
future allocations for current use. However, firms would
not be allowed to comply with the cap by submitting
"offset credits," which reflect reductions in emissions
from sectors that otherwise would not be subject to the
cap.</p>

<p>If implemented, this option would raise revenues by
close to $500 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by
$1.2 trillion from 2012 through 2021. (Because it
would reduce the tax base of income and payroll taxes,
the option would lead to reductions in revenue from
those sources. The estimates shown here reflect those
reductions.)</p>

<p>Those revenue estimates are based on an estimated allowance
price in 2012 of $20 that would increase at an
annual rate of 5.6 percent. Such a price would motivate
firms and households to undertake reductions that cost
up to $20 per metric ton of CO2e to achieve in the initial
year of the policy. The reductions would be economically
justified if those costs were less than the long-term benefits
of each ton of emissions that was reduced. An interagency
federal analysis published in 2010 estimated the
value of the benefit (that is, the damage that would be
avoided) from reducing baseline emissions--those that
would have occurred in the absence of any policy limiting
emissions--by 1 metric ton. According to that study,
the value of that benefit would range from an estimated
$5 to $40 per metric ton in 2012.</p>

<p>An argument that is made in favor of a cap-and-trade
program such as the one described here is that an initial
allowance price of $20 would be justified by the benefits
resulting from the program. In addition to the direct benefits
from reducing the damage associated with climate
change, such a program would generate "co-benefits."
Co-benefits would occur when measures taken to reduce
emissions--such as generating electricity from natural gas
rather than from coal--reduced other pollutants not
explicitly limited by the cap, thereby reducing the harmful
effects associated with those emissions. The magnitude
of those co-benefits is uncertain and depends on
which standards were already in place to limit such pollutants.
However, in terms of the benefits to human
health, a literature survey published in 2010 indicates
that the reductions in other pollutants that would occur
as a by-product of limiting CO2 emissions could be as
large as, or larger than, the direct benefits of reducing
CO2 emissions.</p>

<p>Another argument in favor of the option is that setting an
economywide price on emissions of greenhouse gases
would impose a smaller cost on the economy than the
alternative approach of achieving the same reductions
through various provisions in the existing Clean Air Act
(CAA). Setting an economywide price on greenhouse gas
emissions would lower the cost of reducing emissions by
allowing market forces to determine where, how, and--to
some extent--when such reductions could be achieved.
In contrast, standards issued under the CAA (for example,
specifying an emissions rate for a plant or an energy
efficiency standard for a given product) would offer less
flexibility and, as a result, would achieve emission reduc
tions at a higher cost. Finally, an economywide tax or
cap-and-trade program would provide a potential source
of revenue for the federal government, an option that
would not be available under the existing CAA. The government
could use some of those revenues to accomplish
various goals such as reducing taxes, offsetting the costs of
the cap-and-trade program for certain groups or industries
that are put at a competitive disadvantage by the
program, or reducing the federal deficit.</p>

<p>An argument that is made against policies that limit emissions
is that any attempt to curtail U.S. emissions in the
near term would burden the economy by raising prices
for emissions-intensive goods and services while yielding
benefits of an uncertain magnitude. In addition, most
of those benefits might occur outside the United States,
particularly in developing countries. It is also argued that
reductions in domestic emissions could be offset by
increases in emissions overseas if carbon-intensive industries
relocated to countries that did not impose restrictions
on emissions. Another argument against the option
is that the budgetary savings from a cap-and-trade program
would be diminished if the revenues were used to
fund generous subsidies to industries and households
affected by the program. Moreover, averting the risk of
future damage caused by climate change would depend
on collective global efforts to cut emissions. Most analysts
agree that if other countries with high levels of emissions
do not cut those pollutants over the same period that the
United States does and by roughly the same percentage,
efforts in this country would produce small climate-
related benefits.</p>
