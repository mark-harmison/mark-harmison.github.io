<p>Medicare's voluntary outpatient drug benefit, known as
Part D, is delivered by private drug plans; federal subsidies
for that coverage, net of the premiums that enrollees
pay, totaled $52 billion in 2010. (Those subsidies include
payments to stand-alone prescription drug plans and prescription
drug plans associated with Medicare Advantage
plans, but they exclude subsidies provided to employers
for prescription drug coverage provided by their retiree
health plans.) One way that those drug plans limit the
cost of the Part D benefit is by negotiating rebates from
the manufacturers of brand-name drugs in return for
favorable coverage of those drugs, such as lower copayments
for preferred drugs. That strategy is most likely to
be effective for "single-source" drugs that are not available
in generic form but face competition from other brand-
name drugs to treat the same medical condition. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that in 2008,
rebates under Part D averaged about 14 percent of gross
spending on all brand-name drugs and a slightly higher
percentage of spending on single-source brand-name
drugs.</p>

<p>Prior to the establishment of Part D in 2006, Medicare
beneficiaries who were also eligible for full benefits under
Medicaid--known as "dual eligibles"--received drug
coverage through Medicaid. Drug manufacturers are
required to pay a significant rebate on their sales to Medicaid
enrollees. In 2010, the minimum rebate in the
Medicaid program was increased from 15.1 percent to
23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price (AMP)--
that is, the price that manufacturers receive for sales to
retail pharmacies; additional rebates are required if a
drug's price rises faster than general inflation. When
Part D was established, dual eligibles were enrolled automatically
in a low-income-subsidy (LIS) program, which
typically covers the premiums and most of the cost sharing
required under the basic Part D benefit. Overall, LIS
beneficiaries account for about 40 percent of Part D
enrollees and about 56 percent of Part D spending; most,
but not all, LIS recipients are dual eligibles. Currently,
the prices and rebates for drugs used by LIS enrollees are
established in the same way as those for other Part D
enrollees--that is, through negotiations between Part D
plans and drug makers.</p>

<p>This option would require manufacturers of brand-name
drugs to pay the federal government a rebate on drugs
purchased by enrollees in the LIS program, starting in
2013. The program would reflect the current rebate system
for Medicaid: Manufacturers would be responsible
for a total rebate of at least 23.1 percent of the AMP, plus
an additional rebate for price increases that exceeded the
rate of inflation since the drug's introduction.1 The difference
between that amount and the amount of discounts
and rebates that manufacturers already provide to Part D
drug plans (as defined below) would be paid to the federal
government. If the average Part D rebate for a given
drug already exceeded the sum of 23.1 percent of the
AMP plus the inflation-based rebate, however, no rebate
would be paid to the federal government for that drug.</p>

<p>Manufacturers would be required to participate in the
new Part D rebate program in order for their drugs to be
covered by Parts B and D of Medicare, by Medicaid, and
by the Veterans Health Administration. To reduce the
amount of rebates owed to the federal government,
rebates provided to Part D plans would have to apply to
all drug purchases by all Part D enrollees. Therefore, if
manufacturers set different rebate levels for different subgroups
of beneficiaries, only the lowest rebate provided
would be subtracted when determining the amount
owed to the federal government on purchases by LIS
beneficiaries. In particular, under this option, the
50 percent discount on brand-name drugs that manufacturers
now have to provide for certain drug purchases
would not reduce the rebate owed to the federal government
on purchases by LIS beneficiaries because that
50 percent discount applies only to a subgroup of drug
purchases (those made by beneficiaries who are not
enrolled in the LIS program for drugs purchased within a
specified range of spending).</p>

<p>Under this option, manufacturers would continue to
have an incentive to provide rebates to drug plans in
exchange for preferred coverage of brand-name drugs, but
that incentive would be smaller than under current law
because the federal rebate would make the additional
sales that would result from preferred coverage less profitable.
The rebates obtained by drug plans for purchases
by Part D enrollees would therefore be reduced, CBO
expects. Moreover, drug makers would be expected to set
higher "launch" prices for new drugs to limit the impact
of the new rebate, particularly for new drugs that do not
have close substitutes. Higher launch prices in response to
a minimum rebate requirement in Part D would have
varying effects on other drug purchasers. Employment-
based health insurance plans would probably negotiate
for larger rebates to offset the higher launch prices, but
state Medicaid programs would pay a higher price for
new drugs. Even after accounting for such offsets, CBO
estimates that this option will generate savings to the federal government--about $38 billion over the 2012-2016
period and about $112 billion over the 2012-2021
period.</p>

<p>The main advantage of this option is that Medicare
would pay less for drugs used by LIS beneficiaries in
Part D. Advocates of this option might argue that manufacturers
previously paid a rebate to Medicaid for drugs
purchased by the dual-eligible population (who constitute
the majority of LIS beneficiaries) before those beneficiaries
were reassigned to the Part D benefit, so there
is a recent precedent for requiring such rebates for that
population.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of the option is that the net reduction in
the prices paid for drugs under Part D might reduce the
amount of funds that manufacturers invest in research
and development of new products. Relative to current
law, the option would not significantly reduce the incentive
to develop "breakthrough" drugs because those drugs
could be launched at prices that were high enough to
largely offset the rebate. However, the new rebate would
apply to LIS beneficiaries who are not dual eligibles, so
the magnitude of the total required rebates would be
larger than when dual eligibles received their drug coverage
from Medicaid; consequently, the adverse impact on
manufacturers' incentives would probably be larger than
it was prior to the creation of Part D.</p>
