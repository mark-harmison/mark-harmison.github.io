<div><a name="TAX27"></a><h1>Impose a 5 Percent Value-Added Tax</h1>

<p>
A value-added tax (VAT) is a type of consumption tax
that is collected at each stage of a commodity's production
and distribution. Although a VAT is typically
administered by taxing the total value of a business's sales
of a particular product or service, the business can claim
a credit for the taxes it paid on the "inputs"--such as
materials and equipment--it used to make the product
or provide the service.</p>

<p>More than 140 countries--including all members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), except for the United States--have
adopted VATs. However, the tax bases and rate structures
differ greatly among countries. Most European countries
have implemented VATs that have a narrow tax base, with
certain categories of goods and services--such as food,
education, and health care--either exempted from the
tax or taxed at lower rates than other goods and services.
In Australia and New Zealand, the VAT has a much
broader tax base, with exemptions generally limited only
to those goods and services for which it is difficult to
determine a value. As of January 1, 2010, the average
VAT rate for OECD countries was 18 percent, ranging
from 5 percent in Japan to 25.5 percent in Iceland. All
OECD countries that impose a VAT also collect revenues
from taxes on income and profits.</p>

<p>This option would impose a 5 percent VAT in one of two
ways. The first alternative would apply the VAT to a
broad base that would include most goods and services.
Because their value is difficult to measure, certain
items--such as financial intermediation services, existing
housing services, primary and secondary education, and
other services provided by government agencies and nonprofit
organizations for a nominal or no fee--would be
excluded from the base. (Existing housing services
encompass the monetary rents paid by tenants and rents
imputed to owners who reside in their own homes.)</p>

<p>Although existing housing services would be excluded
under this alternative, the broad base would include all
future consumption of housing services by taxing the
purchase of new residential housing. The broad base
would also exclude government-reimbursed expenditures
for health care (primarily costs paid by Medicare and
Medicaid).</p>

<p>The option would become effective on January 1,
2013--a year later than most of the revenue options presented
in this volume--to provide the Internal Revenue
Service sufficient time to set up and administer a VAT.
The first approach would increase revenues by
$950 billion from 2012 through 2016 and by $2.5 trillion
over the 2012-2021 period. (Because a VAT reduces
the tax base of income and payroll taxes, the imposition
of a VAT would lead to reductions in revenues from
those sources. The estimates shown here reflect those
reductions.)</p>

<p>Under the second alternative, the 5 percent VAT would
apply to a narrower base. In addition to those items
excluded under the broad base, the narrow base would
exclude purchases of new residential housing, food
purchased for home consumption, health care, postsecondary
education, and all other financial services.
This approach would increase revenues by $530 billion
from 2012 through 2016 and by $1.4 trillion over the
2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>One argument in favor of imposing a VAT, as an alternative
to increasing income tax rates, is that such action
would raise revenues without discouraging saving and
investment. Through tax credits, deductions, and exclusions,
the individual income tax provides incentives that
encourage saving, but those types of provisions--each
with their own eligibility rules and income phaseouts--
make the tax system more complicated. By taxing
consumption only, a VAT would exempt saving in a
simpler, more direct fashion.</p>

<p>A drawback of the option is that it would require the federal
government to establish a new system to monitor and
collect the tax. As with any new tax, a VAT would impose
additional administrative costs on the federal government
and additional compliance costs on businesses. Because
such costs are typically higher for smaller businesses,
many countries, including the United Kingdom, exempt
some small businesses from the VAT. A study conducted
by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in
2008 showed that all of the countries evaluated--
Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, and the
United Kingdom--devoted significant resources to
addressing and enforcing compliance. However, the
GAO study also found that a VAT might be less expensive
to administer than an income tax. For example, the
tax administration agency in the United Kingdom estimated
administrative costs for the VAT to be 0.55 percent
of revenue collected, whereas the cost of administering
the income tax was 1.27 percent.</p>

<p>Another argument against imposing a VAT is that it
might increase the prices consumers have to pay for goods
and services relative to the after-tax price sellers would
otherwise receive for providing those goods and services.
Therefore, adopting a VAT would cause an initial jump
in the overall consumer price index because that index is
computed on a tax-inclusive basis. The increase in the
price level, however, would not necessarily lead to further
inflation. If the Federal Reserve adjusted the money
supply in a way that maintained current-dollar income,
little inflation, beyond the initial price jump, would
occur. (If there was an initial increase in the price level,
federal spending for mandatory programs with benefits</p>

<p>that are affected by inflation, such as Social Security,
could increase; parameters of the tax system that are
indexed to inflation could also be affected. However, the
estimates shown here correspond to the standard estimating
convention of holding macroeconomic aggregates--
such as gross domestic product and the overall price
level--unchanged.)</p>

<p>Yet another drawback of imposing a VAT is that the tax
is regressive when its burden is measured on an annual
basis. In any given year, lower-income families--who
consume a greater share of their income than higher-
income families--would pay a larger share of their annual
income in consumption taxes than other families. A VAT
appears to be less regressive when its burden is measured
over a longer period.</p>

<p>The choice between the two alternatives--a broad base
and a narrow base--presents certain trade-offs. A VAT
could be made less regressive by adopting a narrow base
and thus granting tax preferences for the goods and services
that command a relatively larger proportion of
budgets for low-income individuals and families. Those
preferences, however, would substantially increase the
costs of enforcement and compliance, and they would
reduce revenues. In addition, a narrow-based VAT with
exemptions would distort economic decisions to a greater
degree than would a VAT with a broader base.</p>

<p>Policymakers could offset some of the regressive impact
of a VAT by allowing additional exemptions or refundable
credits under the federal income tax for individuals
and families with lower income. That approach could
be specifically targeted to lower- and middle-income
families, but such provisions could add to the complexity
of the individual income tax.</p>
