<p>In 2010, the federal government paid $69 billion in pension
benefits to 2.5 million civilian retirees and their
survivors, as well as $51 billion to 2.2 million military
retirees and their survivors. The government also paid
$43 billion in compensation to 3.5 million disabled veterans
and their survivors and $4 billion in pension benefits
to about 500,000 veterans and their survivors. All of
those benefits are linked to the CPI-W (the consumer
price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers),
but the extent of inflation protection varies from one program
to the next, as does the age at which benefits are
payable.</p>

<p>Pensions paid under the Civil Service Retirement System
(CSRS) are subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments
(COLAs) that provide complete protection against
increases in the CPI-W. Pensions paid under the newer
Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) are fully
protected only when that increase is less than 2 percent
per year. If the percentage increase in the CPI-W is
between 2 percent and 3 percent, FERS annuitants
receive a COLA of 2 percent; if the increase exceeds
3 percent, the COLA is the percentage increase in the
CPI-W minus 1 percentage point. Unless they retire
on disability, FERS annuitants receive COLAs only at
ages 62 and above, whereas all CSRS annuitants receive
COLAs. CSRS and FERS participants generally can
begin to receive pension benefits at age 60 with 20 years
of service or at age 62 with 5 years of service. Participants
with 30 years of service are eligible to receive benefits
even if they retire before the age of 60.</p>

<p>Pensions for military personnel hired before August 1,
1986, garner COLAs that provide complete protection
against increases in the CPI-W. People who entered service
after that date have a choice: They may elect to stay
under the old system and receive a full COLA, or they
can accept a $30,000 bonus after 15 years of service and
receive reduced annual COLAs that equal the percentage
increase in the CPI-W less 1 percentage point. Those
who choose the latter arrangement receive an increase in
their pension at age 62, restoring the annuity to what it
would have been had the full COLA been paid. After age
62, retirees again receive the reduced COLA (but from a
higher base because of the increase at age 62). Most military
personnel have declined the 15-year bonus and
retained eligibility for the full COLA. Active-duty military
personnel are eligible to receive pension benefits after
completing 20 years of service, regardless of age; reservists
are not eligible for retirement annuities until they reach
age 60; and personnel with fewer than 20 years of service
generally are not eligible for any benefits unless they retire
on disability.</p>

<p>Full COLAs are attached to veterans' disability compensation
and pensions. Disability compensation is paid to
veterans with certified disabilities, in amounts that
depend on the severity of the disability. Veterans also are
eligible for means-tested pensions.</p>

<p>This option would replace the CPI-W with the chained
CPI-U (the chained consumer price index for all urban
consumers) as the index by which federal civilian, military,
and veterans' benefits are adjusted for inflation. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that, on average,
the chained CPI-U will grow 0.25 percentage points per
year more slowly than the CPI-W over the next 10 years.
Under this option, annual COLAs would equal the
increase in the chained CPI-U for CSRS annuitants, military
retirees, and veterans. Comparable adjustments
would be made for FERS annuitants when the increase in
the chained CPI-U was less than 2 percent a year. FERS
annuitants would receive a COLA of 2 percent when the
increase in the chained CPI-U was between 2 percent and
3 percent and a COLA 1 percentage point below the
increase in the chained CPI-U when that increase
exceeded 3 percent. Military retirees who chose the
$30,000 bonus under the new system would receive a
reduced COLA equal to the percentage growth in the
chained CPI-U minus 1 percentage point.</p>

<p>The chained CPI-U is initially published as a preliminary
value and then revised over the following two years. As a
result, implementing this option would require the use of
preliminary data. CBO discussed the details of the
approach in a Web-only technical appendix released with
its February 2010 issue brief, Using a Different Measure of
Inflation for Indexing Federal Programs and the Tax Code.</p>

<p>CBO estimates that those changes would decrease mandatory
outlays by about $6 billion between 2012 and
2016 and by $24 billion from 2012 through 2021.
On average, a CSRS annuitant would receive about
$3,900 less over 10 years than under current law; a
FERS annuitant would receive about $1,000 less. The
average military retiree would receive roughly $3,000 less
over 10 years relative to current law, veterans' disability
compensation would be about $1,500 less, and veterans'
pensions would be about $1,200 less. (Using the chained
CPI-U for all federal benefit programs that are indexed
for inflation, including Social Security, would reduce outlays
by about $36 billion through 2016 and by about
$145 billion through 2021.)</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that the CPI-W overstates
increases in the cost of living, so using the chained CPI-U
would reduce federal outlays while still ensuring that benefits
do not fall relative to the cost of living after a recipient
becomes eligible for those benefits. The CPI-W measures
inflation on the basis of price changes for a fixed
basket of goods that is periodically updated. The chained
CPI-U provides a more accurate measure of changes in
the cost of living by more quickly capturing the extent to
which households adjust their consumption when relative
prices change. Another argument in favor of this option is
that federal pension plans would still offer more protection
against inflation than most private pension plans do.</p>

<p>According to a 2001 survey, fewer than 15 percent of
private-sector plans gave annuitants formal annual
COLAs, and another 25 percent made ad hoc cost-ofliving
adjustments.</p>

<p>An argument against reducing the COLA is that the
prices faced by annuitants could rise faster than the prices
faced by the population at large. In particular, annuitants
are likely to spend more than younger people do for medical
care, the price of which generally grows faster than
the prices of many other goods and services. An experimental
price index for goods and services purchased by
the elderly (the CPI-E) grew an average of 0.27 percentage
points per year faster than the CPI-W from 1982 to
2010. Thus, the benefits received by retirees may decline
over time in real terms under current law, and using the
chained CPI-U would accentuate that decline. CSRS
annuitants would be particularly affected because they are
most dependent on their pensions: CSRS annuitants typically
receive larger pensions than FERS annuitants do,
but CSRS annuitants did not receive the matching contributions
to their Thrift Savings Plan accounts for which
FERS annuitants were eligible. Moreover, CSRS annuitants
may have declined to switch to FERS because they
believed that they would always have the protection
against inflation offered by the current COLA rules. Also,
because military personnel can retire earlier and receive
immediate pensions after just 20 years of service, their
lower COLAs would have larger effects over longer periods.
Finally, because current and prospective employees
would be expected to analyze retirement benefits when
comparing alternative wage and benefit packages, reducing
federal retirement benefits could hamper the government's
ability to recruit and retain a highly qualified
workforce.</p>
