<div><a name="SPENDD8"></a><h1>Cancel the Navy and Marine Corps' Joint Strike Fighters and Replace Those Aircraft with F/A-18E/Fs</h1>

<p>The Department of the Navy currently plans to purchase
680 Joint Strike Fighters (JSFs) in two variants: the
F-35B short takeoff vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft for
the Marine Corps and the F-35C carrier-based aircraft
for the Navy. (The Air Force is purchasing F-35As, which
are conventional land-based fighters.) The department
has already placed orders for 53 F-35s through 2011 and
anticipates purchasing 627 more F-35s from 2012
through 2026. The department has estimated that,
including costs to complete development, the remaining
cost for those purchases will amount to $82 billion. The
F-35B and F-35C are still in the developmental stage and
will not enter service for several years.</p>

<p>Under this option, the Department of the Navy would
cancel its plans for further development and fielding of
the F-35B and F-35C and instead purchase additional
F/A-18E/F fighters currently in production. If those aircraft
were purchased at the same rates planned for the
department's F-35s, the option would decrease outlays by
$12 billion over the next five years and save nearly
$18 billion through 2021. The projected savings take
into account increased costs for the 660 F-35As the Air
Force plans to purchase from 2012 through 2021.
(Because the option would affect the JSF program as a
whole--resulting in reduced annual production rates and
fewer total aircraft being purchased--the Air Force's costs
for the F-35A would increase accordingly.) Including the
higher estimated costs for the Air Force's F-35As in years
after 2021 reduces the projected long-term net savings
under this option to $6 billion.</p>

<p>The Congressional Budget Office's estimate of savings
under this option is based on data from the latest available
Selected Acquisition Report. Since that report was
prepared, the Department of Defense has announced that
the JSF program has experienced substantial cost growth
and schedule delays. CBO lacked sufficient details about
those developments to produce a revised estimate of the
savings that could be realized under this option. Savings
from canceling the program would probably be significantly
greater than CBO's estimate for the entire JSF production
run (now likely to include purchases beyond
2026 for the Navy and Marine Corps, if production
quantities remain unchanged). How much the potential
savings over the next 5 or 10 years would change depends
on how purchase schedules change--specifically, to what
extent purchases are postponed to accommodate schedule
delays and cost increases.</p>

<p>An argument for this option is that because of the
F/A-18E/F's relatively new design, that aircraft is
capable of meeting likely threats in the foreseeable
future. In addition, the costs of producing the F/A-18E/F
are well understood. Moreover, further delays in the production
of F-35s could pose significant difficulties
because the Navy is already projecting that production
rates will not be sufficient to match the retirement rate
of F/A-18A/B/C/D fighters, which are approaching the
end of their structural service life. A middle course--
augmenting F-35B/C production with enough
F/A-18E/F purchases to maintain inventory--would
require higher than planned near-term funding to support
the simultaneous production of both aircraft.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that even though the
F/A-18E/F was designed to incorporate stealth features
that the smaller F/A-18C/D does not have, it is still far
less stealthy than the F-35. Consequently, canceling the
F-35 could limit naval aviation operations early in a conflict
before enemy air defenses have been suppressed.
That shortcoming could be mitigated if the Navy's efforts
to develop stealthy unmanned combat aircraft are
successful. Another disadvantage of the option is that
substituting F/A-18s for the STOVL F-35B would mean that are currently offered by the AV-8B Harrier. In
that the Marine Corps could no longer operate fixed-the absence of support by carrier- or land-based aircraft,
wing fighters from the amphibious assault ships in naval the strike groups would have to rely on armed helicopters
expeditionary strike groups or from locations ashore that that do not have the same range, speed, payload, and
cannot accommodate conventional fighters--capabilities survivability as the F-35.</p>
