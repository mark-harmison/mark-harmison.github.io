<div><a name="SPENDD1"></a><h1>Reduce the Growth in Appropriations for the Department of Defense</h1>

<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) receives just over
50 percent of all discretionary appropriations. It would
be difficult, therefore, to achieve a significant reduction
in discretionary spending if DoD appropriations were
excluded from consideration. The breadth of DoD's portfolio
provides many options for absorbing budget cuts of
various magnitudes: It employs nearly 1.5 million military
personnel and 785,000 civilians; operates nearly
500,000 buildings and facilities on approximately 5,000
installations; manages 87 major defense acquisition programs;
and spends about $200 billion annually to
develop and acquire weapons and equipment.</p>

<p>This option includes three alternative paths for reducing
the growth in DoD's appropriations (excluding appropriations
related to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan)
relative to the amounts in the baseline budget projections
of the Congressional Budget Office:</p>

<ul>
<li>
Limit the rate of growth in defense appropriations
beginning in 2012 to an average of 1.4 percent a
year--1 percentage point less than the rate of growth
in CBO's baseline--and thereby reduce outlays by
about $286 billion (or 5 percent) over the 2012-2021
period.</li>
<li>
Freeze defense appropriations at the annualized level
for 2011 under the continuing resolution that was in
effect in February 2011, thus reducing outlays by
about $611 billion (or 10 percent) over the 2012-
2021 period.</li>
<li>
Reduce defense appropriations by 1 percent annually
from the 2011 level, thereby decreasing outlays by an
estimated $862 billion (or 15 percent) over the next
10 years. Under that alternative, DoD's appropriations
would return to their 2007 funding level--in nominal
terms--by 2021. If those reductions were distributed
proportionally, a decrease of 400,000 active-duty personnel
(about 25 percent of active and reserve personnel)
could be required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding for DoD's regular activities (excluding appropriations
for overseas contingency operations) has increased
by approximately 75 percent over the past 10 years, or by
about 40 percent adjusted for inflation. Thus, DoD
would have more buying power than it had a decade ago
even if its regular budget was reduced substantially relative
to the amounts in CBO's baseline. If regular defense
appropriations had grown at the rate of inflation since
2001 and continued to do so through 2021, budget
authority in 2021 would total $465 billion, $200 billion
less than the amount in the baseline. Even if those
appropriations were reduced by 1 percent per year from
the current level (as described in the third alternative),
funding would still be $10 billion more in 2021 than it
would have been if appropriations had grown with inflation
since 2001.</p>

<p>An argument for reducing defense spending is that doing
so could reduce the deficit and promote economic
growth by redirecting resources from soldiers and weapons
to more-productive uses. Furthermore, U.S. defense
expenditures are almost as large as the combined defense
expenditures of all other nations. Proponents of this
option might contend, therefore, that the United States
could still field a relatively robust military force on a
smaller budget. Moreover, many beneficiaries of U.S.
defense spending, such as allied nations in Europe, have
economies large enough to pay for more of their own
defense.</p>

<p>An argument against cutting the growth in DoD's appropriations
is that the nation needs to maintain or increase
defense spending to counter the increasingly sophisticated
threats posed by current and potential adversaries.
Weapon systems and facilities are aging, and the costs of
replacing them with more-capable systems have grown.
Further, the armed forces require sufficient military personnel
to defend the nation's interests abroad without
overburdening service members with too-frequent
deployments. In addition, the costs of military compensation,
particularly health care costs, have been growing
rapidly and will probably continue to do so. By CBO's
estimates, the multiyear plans that DoD had in place in
2010 would involve costs that are almost $600 billion
more than CBO's baseline projections over the 2012-
2021 period.</p>
