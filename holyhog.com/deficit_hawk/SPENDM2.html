<div><a name="SPENDM2"></a><h1>Transfer the Tennessee Valley Authority's Electric Utility Functions and Associated Assets and Liabilities</h1>

<p>In 1933, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was
established as a federal agency to control flooding,
improve navigation, and develop the hydroelectric
resources of the Tennessee River for the benefit of a
seven-state region in the southeastern United States.
Since then, TVA has developed an extensive network
of transmission facilities and nuclear- and fossil-fuelpowered
electricity-generating plants. As one of the largest
electric utilities in the nation, TVA accounted for
5 percent of national electricity generation in 2010. To
maintain sufficient capacity, TVA anticipates that it will
need to make large capital expenditures in the next
decade and beyond. TVA funds its investments primarily
by issuing debt, and it services those debt obligations
from revenues earned through electricity sales to customers
over several decades.</p>

<p>This option would transfer most of TVA's electric utility
functions and associated assets and liabilities to a non-
federal owner and operator--a private firm, for example,
or to an entity owned by its distributors. That entity
could be similar to the newly formed Seven States Power
Corporation, a nonprofit electricity generation and transmission
cooperative in the Tennessee Valley. The hydropower
assets and liabilities would be retained by the government
because they serve several other purposes, such
as flood control and recreation. This option assumes that
the transfer of TVA's electric utility functions and associated
assets and liabilities would be completed by the end
of 2013. Such a transfer could be accomplished in different
ways: TVA's assets and liabilities could be conveyed
free of charge, for example, or they could be sold in a
competitive auction to a nonfederal entity. Proceeds from
such an auction would depend on the terms and conditions
of the sale. As a result, potential proceeds are not
included in this estimate.</p>

<p>Even in the absence of auction proceeds, the Congressional
Budget Office estimates that implementing this
option will reduce net outlays by about $1 billion over</p>

<p>the 2012-2016 period and by nearly $4 billion over the
2012-2021 period. Those savings reflect the estimated
net outlays that TVA otherwise would have incurred to
build new electric power facilities over the next 10 years.
CBO's estimate assumes that the current $30 billion ceiling
on TVA's borrowing would be maintained; if that
ceiling was raised, the budgetary savings from this option
would probably be greater over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>The 10-year budgetary impact of such a capital transfer
does not fully capture its long-term impact on the government.
For example, although the government would
avoid new capital outlays, it would also forgo a stream of
future income that would accrue from those outlays.
That income would not fully compensate for the up-
front capital costs, however, because of the implicit
subsidies conveyed to ratepayers in the region. By law,
TVA's rates are set to recover its costs and maintain an
operating reserve. But the capital charge included in
those rates is artificially low because, unlike private utilities,
TVA does not have to provide a return to equity
holders--in this case, the taxpayers, who are exposed to
the risk of having to make up for future revenue shortfalls.
In addition, TVA's borrowing costs are relatively low
because its status as a federal agency leads many creditors
to assume that TVA's obligations would be paid off in
the event of default, even though existing law explicitly
states that TVA's debts are not guaranteed by the federal
government.</p>

<p>One rationale for this option is that transferring ownership
could give state regulatory agencies and TVA's customers
more control over future costs. TVA is exempt
from most state regulatory review because of its status as a
federal agency. Its operations are sheltered from competition,
moreover, because federal law requires customers in
its service area to purchase virtually all of their electricity
from TVA. Increased competition, proponents would
argue, could produce greater efficiency and improve cost
control. In addition, many would argue that the generation and transmission of electricity are fundamentally
private-sector activities. A final rationale is that it would
eliminate the implicit subsidies that the government now
provides to the region's ratepayers.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that TVA's contribution
to the economic development of its seven-state
region could be diminished if TVA was under nonfederal
ownership. For example, a new owner might reduce
expenditures on efforts to attract new businesses to the
communities in TVA's service area. Furthermore, a reduction
in public subsidies would probably cause an increase
in electricity prices. Finally, regulatory and other constraints
on the new owner and operator of TVA's system
could limit the potential benefits of a transfer.</p>
