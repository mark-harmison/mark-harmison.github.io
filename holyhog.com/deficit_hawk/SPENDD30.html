<p>The Senior Community Service Employment Program
(SCSEP) funds part-time jobs for low-income people
age 55 or older who have poor prospects for other
employment. Participation in the program in 2010
was limited to people whose annual income was below
125 percent of the federal poverty level (for someone
living alone, $13,500). SCSEP grants are competitively
awarded to nonprofit organizations and state agencies
that hire SCSEP participants to work in part-time community
service jobs. In 2010, $825 million was appropriated
for the program. That appropriation included
$225 million to fund a one-time expansion for the 2009-
2010 and 2010-2011 program years ($66 million and
$159 million, respectively).</p>

<p>Participants in the program are paid the federal or state
minimum wage or the prevailing local wage for similar
employment, whichever is higher. They are offered
annual physical examinations as well as training, counseling,
and assistance with moving into unsubsidized jobs
when they complete their projects. The Department of
Labor estimates that SCSEP had about 99,000 participants
in 2009 working in schools, hospitals, and senior
citizens' centers and on beautification and conservation
projects.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate the SCSEP, reducing federal
outlays by about $4 billion through 2016 and by about
$8 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>An argument in support of this option is that the cost of
subsidizing program participants' wages and the other
benefits they receive for their services could be borne by
the organizations that gain from their work; under current
law, those organizations usually bear just 10 percent
of such costs. Shifting the full cost of the services to the
organizations would increase the likelihood that only the
most highly valued services would be provided.</p>

<p>An argument against this option is that eliminating
SCSEP, which is a major federal jobs program for low-
income older workers, could cause serious hardship for
some people. Although, in general, older workers are less
likely than younger workers to be unemployed, if they are
without a job it can take longer for them to find work,
particularly during periods of high unemployment.</p>
