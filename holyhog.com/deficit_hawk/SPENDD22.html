<div><a name="SPENDD22"></a><h1>Increase Fees for Aviation Security</h1>

<p>The attacks of September 11, 2001, led to sweeping
changes to increase security in the nation's transportation
systems. One major change occurred when the Aviation
and Transportation Security Act of 2001 made the federal
government, rather than airlines and airports, responsible
for screening passengers, carry-on luggage, and checked
baggage. Implementing the new standards required the
hiring of screeners who were more highly qualified and
trained, necessitating increased compensation and raising
overall security costs.</p>

<p>To help pay for increased security, the law directed
airlines to charge passengers a fee, remitted to the government,
of $2.50 for a one-way trip with no stops and
$5.00 for a trip with one or more stops. The 2001 law
also authorized the government to impose fees on the
airlines themselves and to reimburse airlines, airport
operators, and service providers for the costs of security
enhancements. In 2010, the Transportation Security
Administration collected $2.1 billion from the fees on
passengers and airlines--less than half of the $5.5 billion
federal aviation security budget that year.</p>

<p>This option would increase fees to cover a greater portion
of the federal government's costs for aviation security.
Passengers would pay a flat fee of $5 per one-way trip
because travelers typically pass through security screening
only once per one-way trip. Implementing the option
would boost collections (and thus reduce net spending)
by about $10 billion through 2016 and by almost
$21 billion over the 2012-2021 period. Under standard
budgetary treatment, the collections would be classified
as revenues, but because the Aviation and Transportation
Security Act requires that revenues from the existing fees
be recorded as offsets to federal spending, the budgetary
impact of this option is presented that way.</p>

<p>The arguments for and against this option rest on the
principle that the beneficiaries of a service should pay for
it. The differences lie in who is seen as benefiting from
such measures. A justification for the option is that the
primary beneficiaries of transportation security enhancements
are the users of the system. Security is viewed as a
basic cost of airline transportation in the same way that
fuel and labor costs are. The current situation, in which
those costs are covered partly by taxpayers in general and
partly by users of the aviation system, provides a subsidy
to air transportation.</p>

<p>Conversely, an argument against higher fees is that the
public in general--not just air travelers--benefits from
improved airport security. To the extent that greater security
reduces the risk of terrorist attacks, the entire population
is better off. That reasoning suggests that the federal
government should fund at least part of the enhanced
transportation security measures without collecting additional
funds directly from the airline industry or its
customers.</p>
