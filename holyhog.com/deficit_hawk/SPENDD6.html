<div><a name="SPENDD6"></a><h1>Consolidate the Department of Defense's Retail Activities and Provide a Grocery Allowance to Service Members</h1>

<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) operates four retail
systems on military bases: a network of grocery stores
(commissaries) that serves all branches of the armed
forces and three separate chains of general retail stores
(exchanges). One system of exchanges serves the Army
and Air Force, a second serves the Navy, and a third serves
the Marine Corps. This option would consolidate those
systems into a single retail system that would operate
more efficiently and without any appropriated subsidy.
Like the current separate systems, the consolidated system
would give military personnel access to low-cost groceries
and other goods at all DoD installations, including
those in isolated or overseas locations.</p>

<p>The existing commissary and exchange systems operate
under very different funding mechanisms. The commissary
system, which is run by the Defense Commissary
Agency (DeCA), has yearly sales of about $6 billion, but
it also receives an annual appropriation of about $1.3 billion.
The three exchange systems have annual sales that
total about $12 billion. They receive no direct appropriations;
instead, they rely on sales revenue to cover most of
their costs. A relatively small portion of their costs, such
as expenses for transporting merchandise overseas, is paid
from appropriations elsewhere in the defense budget.</p>

<p>The exchanges can operate without an appropriated subsidy
because they charge customers a higher markup over
wholesale prices than commissaries do. Also, because the
exchange systems are nonappropriated-fund (NAF)
entities--that is, they rely mostly on funds generated
from sales to finance their operations instead of appropriations
from the federal government--they have more
flexibility in business practices for personnel and procurement.
By contrast, DeCA's employees are civil service
personnel, and it must follow standard federal procurement
practices. This option is based on the assumption
that consolidating the four retail systems would eliminate
duplicative administrative functions and that DeCA's
civil service employees would be converted to the NAF
workforce.</p>

<p>Under this option, the commissary and exchange systems
would be consolidated over a five-year period. At the end
of that period, the budget authority required to operate
the combined system would be lower by almost $2 billion
per year. This option would return about a third of
that amount to active-duty service members through a
tax-free grocery allowance to each of the roughly 1.4 million
active-duty service members. The grocery allowance
would be phased in to coincide with the consolidation of
commissary and exchange stores at each base. The net
annual savings in budget authority by 2016 would be a
little over $1 billion. Outlay savings to DoD over the
next decade would total about $8 billion.</p>

<p>To operate within budget and without appropriated
funds, the consolidated system would have to charge
about 7 percent more for groceries and other merchandise.
At the current volume of sales at the commissaries
and exchanges, a 7 percent increase in prices would cost
military personnel--active-duty, reserve, and retired--
and their families an additional $1.4 billion annually.</p>

<p>Active-duty members and their families would pay about
$400 more per year, on average, but that amount would
be offset by the new grocery allowance. Cash allowances
would be particularly attractive to personnel who lived
off base and could shop more conveniently near home or
online. All military families would benefit from longer
store hours, one-stop shopping, access to private-label
groceries (which are not currently sold in commissaries),
and the greater certainty inherent in a military shopping
benefit that did not depend on the annual appropriation
process. Another advantage is that the $400 average
grocery allowance could be targeted toward specific pay
grades or groups, with larger allowances given to enhance
retention or to benefit junior enlisted members with large
families, for example.</p>

<p>DoD's retail system would benefit as well. Commissaries
and exchanges must now compete with online retailers
and the large discount chains that have opened discount
grocery and general merchandise stores just outside the
gates of many military installations. Recent tightening of
base security procedures and changes in the civilian retail
industry have made it more difficult and costly for DoD's</p>

<p>fragmented retail systems to provide those services. This
option would allow a consolidated system staffed by NAF
employees to better compete with civilian alternatives.</p>

<p>One argument against consolidation is that about
$750 million of the price increases would be borne by the
military retirees who shop in commissaries and exchanges
but who, under the option, would not receive grocery
allowances. The average family of a retired service member
would pay about $325 more per year for groceries.</p>
