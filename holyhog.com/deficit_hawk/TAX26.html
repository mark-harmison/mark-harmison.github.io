<div><a name="TAX26"></a><h1>Exempt Active Foreign Dividends from U.S. Taxation and Change the Tax Treatment of Overhead Expenses</h1>

<p>The federal government taxes the income that U.S. businesses
earn both at home and abroad. Most of the income
that U.S. corporations earn from their foreign subsidiaries'
business activities is not subject to taxation in the
United States until it is repatriated in the form of dividends
that the subsidiaries pay to their parent company.
Other forms of foreign income, such as royalties, interest,
and "passive" income--that is, income derived from business
assets by investors with little or no personal participation
in the business--are subject to U.S. tax as that
income is earned.</p>

<p>To prevent income earned abroad from being subject to
both foreign and U.S. taxation, the tax code gives U.S.
corporations a credit that reduces their domestic tax liability
by the amount of income and withholding taxes
they have paid to foreign governments. The foreign tax
credit is subject to limits that are designed to ensure that
the value of the credits taken does not exceed the amount
of U.S. tax that otherwise would have been due. Those
limits also are intended to prevent corporations from
using foreign tax credits as a way to reduce taxes on
income earned in the United States. For computing those
credit limits, the overhead expenses (such as interest
costs) that a U.S. parent company incurs for its operations
must be allocated between domestic and foreign
activities. (When computing taxable income, however,
firms can deduct total overhead expenses, regardless of
the source.)</p>

<p>This option would exempt from U.S. taxation "active"
dividends--those that U.S. corporations earn from the
business operations of their foreign subsidiaries or foreign
branches. All other foreign income (including royalties,
interest, and income from passive activities) would be
taxed in the current manner--as it is earned. Foreign
tax credits would be allowed so that companies could
offset any foreign income taxes or withholding taxes paid
on foreign income that was still subject to U.S. taxation.
Overhead costs, such as interest expenses, of a U.S. parent
company would be allocated between the company's</p>

<p>U.S. and foreign activities, as is the case under current
law for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit. In a
departure from current law, however, overhead expenses
allocated to foreign income would no longer be deductible
from U.S. income. Those changes would increase
revenues by a total of $32 billion from 2012 through
2016 and by $76 billion over the 2012-2021 period.
The revenue lost by exempting active dividends from
U.S. taxation would be more than offset by increases in
taxes on other sources of income. Specifically, taxes on
U.S. income would rise because overhead expenses allocated
to exempt foreign income could no longer be
deducted from U.S. income. In addition, companies that
paid high foreign income taxes could no longer use the
foreign tax credits associated with repatriated dividends
to shield other low-tax foreign income, such as royalties
and export income, from U.S. taxes.
An argument in favor of this option is that such a change
would reduce the complexity of the tax system. Current
rules allow U.S. multinational corporations to reduce
their worldwide taxes by carefully planning how and
when to repatriate dividend income from their foreign
subsidiaries. Researchers have estimated the total costs of
such planning to be more than $1 billion per year. This
option would eliminate those planning costs. It is also
argued that this option would allow foreign tax-credit
rules to be simplified because many of those rules would
no longer apply to active dividend income.</p>

<p>An argument against such a policy change is that it over U.S. investment and thus reducing the amount
would have the same effect as the current tax system, of capital available for production in the United States.
