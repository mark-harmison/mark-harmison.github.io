<p>Social Security benefits for retired and disabled workers
are based on those individuals' average earnings over a
lifetime. The Social Security Administration uses a statutory
formula to compute a worker's initial benefit, and
through a process known as wage indexing, the benefit
formula changes each year to account for economywide
growth of wages. Average initial benefits for Social Security
recipients therefore tend to grow at the same rate as
do average wages, and such benefits replace a roughly
constant portion of wages. (After people become eligible
for benefits, their monthly benefits also are adjusted
annually to account for increases in the cost of living.)</p>

<p>One way to constrain the growth of Social Security benefits
would be to change the initial benefit computation so
that the real (inflation-adjusted) value of average initial
benefits did not rise over time. That approach, often
called "price indexing," would allow increases in real
wages to result in higher real Social Security payroll taxes
but not in higher real benefits. Specifically, beginning
with participants who became eligible for benefits in
2012, this option would link the growth of initial benefits
to the growth of prices (as measured by changes in the
consumer price index) rather than to the growth of average
wages. (The calculation of average indexed monthly
earnings, a key step in the statutory formula for determining
Social Security benefits, would continue to
involve wage indexing. However, the benefit would be
multiplied by the ratio of a price index to an average wage
index--where the indexes are set to be equal in 2011.)</p>

<p>Switching to indexing initial benefits on the basis of
prices rather than wages--a "pure price-indexing"
approach--would reduce federal outlays by about
$13 billion over five years and by almost $137 billion
over the next decade. By 2050, scheduled Social Security
outlays would be reduced by 29 percent relative to what
would occur under current law--from 5.9 percent to
4.2 percent of gross domestic product.
Under pure price indexing, the reduction in payments
relative to those that are scheduled to be paid under current
law would be larger for each successive cohort of
beneficiaries; the extent of the reduction would be determined
by the growth of real wages. For example, if real
wages grew by 1.3 percent annually (approximately the
rate used in the Congressional Budget Office's long-term
Social Security projections), workers who were first eligible
for benefits in 2012 would receive about 1.3 percent
less than they would have received under the current
rules; those becoming eligible in 2013 would receive
2.6 percent less; and so on. In reality, however, the incremental
reduction would vary from year to year, depending
on actual growth in real earnings. If real earnings
shrank during a period--that is, if average wages grew
more slowly than prices--then benefits would grow faster
than they would under current law. Those eligible for
benefits in 2030, CBO estimates, would experience a
reduction in benefits of about 25 percent relative to benefits
scheduled under current law, and the reduction
would grow to more than 40 percent by 2050.
An alternative approach, called "progressive price indexing,"
would retain the current formula for workers who
had lower earnings and would reduce the growth of initial
benefits only for workers who had higher earnings.
Currently, the formula for calculating initial Social Security
benefits is structured so that workers who have higher
earnings receive higher benefits, but the benefits paid to
workers with lower earnings replace a larger share of their
earnings. Under the specifications for progressive price
indexing in this option, initial benefits for the 30 percent
of workers with the lowest lifetime earnings would
increase with average wages, as they are currently slated to
do, whereas initial benefits for higher-income workers
would increase more slowly, at a rate that depended on
their position in the distribution of earnings. For example,
for workers whose earnings put them at the 31st percentile
of the distribution, benefits would rise only
slightly more slowly than wages, whereas for the highest
earners, benefits would rise with prices--as they would
under pure price indexing. Thus, under progressive price
indexing, the initial benefits for most workers would
increase more quickly than prices but more slowly than
average wages. As a result, the benefit formula would
gradually become flatter, and after about 60 years, everyone
in the top 70 percent of earners would receive the
same monthly benefit. A partially flat benefit formula
would represent a significant change from Social Security's
traditional structure, under which workers who pay
higher taxes receive higher benefits.</p>

<p>Progressive price indexing would reduce scheduled Social
Security outlays less than would pure price indexing, and
beneficiaries with lower earnings would not be affected.
Real annual average benefits would still increase for all
but the highest-earning beneficiaries. Benefits would
replace a smaller portion of affected workers' earnings
than they do today but a larger portion than they would
under pure price indexing.</p>

<p>A switch to progressive price indexing would reduce federal
outlays by more than $8 billion over 5 years and by
about $85 billion over 10 years. By 2050, outlays for
Social Security would be reduced by 18 percent, or from
5.9 percent to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product.
Under both approaches, the reductions in benefits relative
to current law would be greatest for beneficiaries in
the distant future. Those beneficiaries, however, would
have had higher real earnings during their working years
and thus a greater ability to save for retirement.</p>

<p>An advantage of both approaches in this option is that,
although they would reduce outlays for Social Security
compared with those scheduled to be paid under current
law, average inflation-adjusted benefits in the program
would not decline over time. If the pure price-indexing
approach was followed, future beneficiaries would generally
receive the same real monthly benefit paid to current
beneficiaries, and they would, as average longevity
increased, receive a larger total lifetime benefit.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of both approaches is that because benefits
would no longer be linked to wages, affected beneficiaries
would no longer share in overall economic growth.
As a result, benefits would replace a smaller portion
of workers' earnings than they do today. Another disadvantage
is that relative to currently scheduled benefits,
reductions would be largest during periods of high wage
growth. Finally, the options would continue to reduce the
rate of growth of scheduled benefits beyond what is
needed to bring Social Security outlays in line with
revenues.</p>
