<div><a name="SPENDD35"></a><h1>End Enrollment in VA Medical Care for Veterans in Priority Groups 7 and 8</h1>

<p>Veterans who seek medical care from the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA) are enrolled in one of eight priority-
care groups that are defined on the basis of income, disability
status, and other factors. Veterans in priority
group 8 do not have service-connected disabilities, and
their annual income or net worth exceeds both VA's
means-testing thresholds and VA's geographic income
thresholds, which are updated annually. Veterans enrolled
in priority group 7 have no service-connected disabilities,
and their income is above the VA's means-testing threshold
but below the VA's geographic index. About 2.3 million
veterans who are currently enrolled in the VA health
care system have been assigned to priority groups 7 and 8;
not all of those veterans seek medical care from VA in any
given year.</p>

<p>Although veterans in those groups pay no annual enrollment
fees, they make copayments for their care; if they
have private health insurance, VA bills those insurance
plans for reimbursement. Copayments and private-plan
billings cover about 18 percent of the cost of those veterans'
care. In 2009, VA incurred $4.4 billion in net costs
for those patients, or about 11 percent of the department's
total appropriations for medical care (excluding
the medical care collections fund, in which amounts collected
or recovered from first- or third-party payers are
deposited and used for medical services for veterans).
When the priority system was established in law in 1996,
the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs was
given the authority to decide which priority groups VA
could serve each year. By 2003, VA could no longer adequately
serve all enrollees, prompting the department to
cut off new enrollment of veterans in priority group 8.
Veterans who were already enrolled were allowed to
remain in the program. VA eased that restriction in 2009
to allow some additional enrollment of priority group 8
veterans.</p>

<p>This option would close enrollment for priority groups
7 and 8 and cancel the enrollment of all veterans currently
in those two groups. Such action would curtail
VA's health care spending for veterans who do not have
service-related medical needs and who are not poor. To be
eligible for VA medical services under this option, a veteran
would have to qualify for a higher priority group
by demonstrating a service-connected disability, by
documenting income and assets that were below the
means-testing thresholds, or by qualifying under other
criteria (such as exposure to Agent Orange, status as a
Purple Heart recipient or a former prisoner of war,
eligibility for Medicaid, or catastrophic non-serviceconnected
disability).</p>

<p>Disenrolling all priority groups 7 and 8 veterans would
reduce discretionary outlays on net by almost $30 billion
between 2012 and 2016 and by about $62 billion
between 2012 and 2021. Those estimates reflect the
assumption that appropriations would be reduced
accordingly. However, because this option would result in
greater use of other government health care programs,
implementing the option would increase mandatory
spending for Medicare and Medicaid and for federal subsidies
provided through health insurance exchanges by
about $15 billion between 2012 and 2016 and by
$34 billion between 2012 and 2021.</p>

<p>An advantage of this option is that it would refocus
VA's attention and services on its traditional group of
patients--those with the greatest needs or fewest financial
resources. Higher-income veterans without service-
connected disabilities gained access to the VA system only
in the mid-1990s, when the federal budget was under less
strain and experiencing less demand for services by
higher-priority veterans. In 2007, 90 percent of enrollees
in priority groups 7 and 8 had other health care coverage,
most notably Medicare and private health insurance. As a
result, the vast majority of the veterans who would lose
VA coverage under this option would have continued
access to other sources of coverage, and veterans without
other health insurance options could be eligible to obtain
coverage through health insurance exchanges in future
years.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of the option is that veterans enrolled in
priority groups 7 and 8 who have come to rely on VA for
at least part of their medical care might find their health
care disrupted by the change in enrollment rules. Some of
those veterans--particularly those whose income was just
above the income thresholds--might have difficulty
identifying other sources of care. In addition, because of
the relatively low out-of-pocket cost to veterans for VA
health care, veterans switching to alternative sources of
care might pay more than they would have paid at VA.</p>
