<div><a name="SPENDM30"></a><h1>Raise the Full Retirement Age in Social Security</h1>

<p>The age at which workers become eligible for full retirement
benefits--the full retirement age, also called the
normal retirement age--depends on their year of birth.
For workers born before 1938, that age was 65. The age
of eligibility increased in two-month increments until it
reached 66 for workers born in 1943. For workers born
between 1944 and 1954, the age holds at 66, but it
increases again in two-month increments until reaching
67 for workers born in 1960 or later. Workers who turn
62 in 2022 or later will be subject to a full retirement age
of 67. Workers will continue to be able to receive benefits
at age 62, but at that age, the amount of benefits is
smaller than the amount they would receive by waiting
until the full retirement age to claim benefits.</p>

<p>Under this option, the full retirement age would increase
by two-month increments for 6 years, rising to 66 years
and 2 months for workers born in 1950 (who turn 62 in
2012) and reaching 67 for workers who were born in
1955 or later (who turn 62 in 2017 or later). Thereafter,
it would continue to increase by two months per year
until reaching 70 for workers born in 1973 (who turn 62
in 2035). As under current law, workers could still choose
to begin receiving reduced benefits at 62, but the reductions
would be larger. The benefits of workers who qualify
for disability insurance would not be reduced under
this approach.</p>

<p>This approach to constraining growth is equivalent in its
effects on benefits to reducing earnings-replacement
rates. (Mandatory Spending--Option 28 offers an alternative
method of reducing those rates.) Depending on
the age at which a worker claims benefits, a one-year
increase in the full retirement age is equivalent to a reduction
in a retired worker's monthly benefit of between
5 percent and 8 percent. Because many workers retire at
the full retirement age, increasing that age is likely to
result in beneficiaries' making claims later than they
would if a policy with identical benefits at each age was
implemented through adjustments in the benefit formula.
For the same reason, this option also would probably
lead workers to remain employed longer, which
would increase the size of the workforce and boost federal
revenues from income and payroll taxes. Moreover, the
additional work would result in higher future Social
Security benefits, although the increase in benefits would
be smaller than the increase in revenues. The 10-year estimates
for this option do not include those two effects.</p>

<p>This option would shrink federal outlays by about
$12 billion over 5 years and by nearly $120 billion over
10 years. By 2050, the option would reduce Social Security
outlays relative to what would occur under current
law by 12 percent--from 5.9 percent to 5.2 percent of
gross domestic product.</p>

<p>A rationale for this option is that people who turn 65
today will, on average, collect Social Security benefits for
significantly longer than retirees did in the past and the
average life span in the United States is expected to continue
to lengthen. In 1940, life expectancy at age 65 was
11.9 years for men and 13.4 years for women. The Social
Security trustees estimate that life expectancy has risen by
more than 5 years for 65-year-olds, to 17.3 years for men
and 19.7 years for women, and that those figures will
increase to 19.0 years and 21.1 years by 2035. Therefore,
a commitment to provide retired workers with a certain
monthly benefit beginning at age 65 in 2035 is significantly
more costly than is that same commitment made
to today's recipients.
An argument against this option is that it would reduce
resources provided to older people, relative to those that
are scheduled to be provided under current law. In addition,
it would create a somewhat stronger incentive for
older workers nearing retirement to apply for disability
benefits. Under current law, workers who retire at age 62
in 2035 will receive 70 percent of their primary insurance
amount (the benefit they would have received if they
had claimed benefits at their full retirement age); if they
qualify for disability benefits, however, they will receive
100 percent of that amount. Under this option, workers
who retired at 62 in 2035 would receive only 55 percent
of their primary insurance amount; they would still
receive 100 percent if they qualified for disability bene-the difference by also reducing scheduled disability pay-
fits. The estimates of the budgetary effects of this option ments--for example, by setting the benefits for disabled
account for the effect on the Social Security Disability workers at the amount they would have received upon
Insurance program. To eliminate that added incentive to retiring at age 65.
apply for disability benefits, policymakers could narrow</p>
