<div><a name="SPENDM24"></a><h1>Eliminate the Critical Access Hospital, Medicare-Dependent Hospital, and Sole Community Hospital Programs in Medicare</h1>

<p>Hospitals designated as critical access hospitals (CAHs),
Medicare-dependent hospitals (MDHs), and sole community
hospitals (SCHs) are exempt from the Inpatient
Prospective Payment System (IPPS) through which
Medicare pays for services provided by most acute care
hospitals. Eligibility for the CAH, MDH, and SCH designations
is based on several factors, including size and
location. Most of the hospitals exempt from the IPPS are
small, rural facilities. Some of those hospitals receive payments
equal to 101 percent of the costs of providing care,
while others receive payments based on a blend of IPPS
rates and their costs. Hospitals benefiting from the special
adjustments for CAHs, MDHs, and SCHs are paid about
25 percent more, on average, for inpatient and outpatient
services than the payments that would otherwise apply.
Currently, one-third of hospitals benefit from those designations
and account for about 10 percent of total Medicare
spending for hospital inpatient services.</p>

<p>This option would eliminate the CAH, MDH, and SCH
programs and end the higher Medicare payments made to
those facilities. Instead, payment to those hospitals, as
with other hospitals paid through the IPPS, would be
determined prospectively on the basis of the following:
patients' diagnoses and the severity of their illness or
injury; geographic variations in hospital "input" costs (for
example, for professional labor or medical supplies); and
certain other hospital- and patient-specific factors, such
as the hospital's teaching status and Medicaid caseload.
By eliminating the CAH, MDH, and SCH programs and
the higher payments to hospitals participating in those
programs, this option would reduce federal outlays by
$23 billion over the 2012-2016 period and by approximately
$62 billion over the 2012-2021 period.</p>

<p>An argument in favor of eliminating the CAH, MDH,
and SCH programs is that doing so would move Medicare
toward a payment structure that compensates all hospitals
in a consistent manner. Smaller rural hospitals
would no longer be able to participate in programs that
compensated them at relatively higher rates. Additionally,
this option might improve efficiency in the health care
system. IPPS payments are intended to encourage efficiency
by compensating hospitals for the costs that reasonably
efficient providers would incur in furnishing
high-quality care (including adjustments for local input
costs). By placing CAHs, MDHs, and SCHs under the
IPPS, those hospitals would face greater incentives to
provide efficient care.</p>

<p>A potential drawback of this option is that the special
payments currently made to the CAHs, MDHs, and
SCHs may offset the higher costs of operating smaller
facilities in rural areas. If those hospitals are not able to
reduce their costs under the IPPS, the increased financial
pressure resulting from the elimination of special payments
to CAHs, MDHs, and SCHs might force some of
those hospitals to convert to outpatient facilities or even
to close. To the extent that occurred, patients who reside
in those areas might have difficulty getting access to care.</p>
