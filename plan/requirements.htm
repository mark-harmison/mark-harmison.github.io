<h1>Octagon House Requirements</h1>

<p>Clearly a lot of house designs could meet our
requirements without being octagonal (in fact being octagonal makes it harder
is some ways), but there is this intangible quality that we just call "magic"
that we have only rarely found in a house. 
Since we have actually been in the house that is our model and found magic
there, we feel confident our design will have a little magic, too.</p>

<h2>Givens</h2>

<p>Basic 16ft octagon, modeled on house from Friendship, New
  York, now located at Genesee
 Country Village
in Mumford, New
  York (circa 1870). 
The key elements of this house we want to preserve include the central
stairway with landings, the second floor hallway/landing, having the master
bedroom secluded on the second floor, the cupola, and the porch.</p>

<h2>Basic Space Needs</h2>

<p>Within this form we want the following functional spaces
(details for each space are provided later):</p>

<ul>
<li>Main entrance.</li>

<li>Formal living room.</li>

<li>Formal/semi-formal dining room.</li>

<li>Kitchen for one cook.</li>

<li>"Television" or "family" room.</li>

<li>Service entrance with ample room for "dog management."</li>

<li>Guest bathroom.</li>

<li>Home-office space for Mark (full-time) and Lisa
(part-time).</li>

<li>Master bedroom.</li>

<li>Master bathroom attached to master bedroom.</li>

<li>Two additional bedrooms.</li>

<li>One additional full-bathroom.</li>

<li>Unfinished space for ping-pong table and starting
seeds.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Site Conditions</h2>

<p>The site for the house has these conditions (in addition to
those shown on the site survey):</p>

<ul>
<li>The property is divided into two legal lots, Lot
1 and Lot 2, collectively known as "Windy 500
Subdivision."  The dividing line runs
parallel to the north edge of the subdivision, 100ft south.
  This was chosen to allow the existing house
to minimally meet set-back requirements so that Lot 2
would have as much buildable area as possible.</li>

<li>Location constrained by (a) flood-plain over majority
of property, (b) existing structures, and (c) set-back requirements.</li>

<li>Electric service is via overhead wire and transformer
located  on Lot
2.  Overhead wires service the existing
house, an underground wire services the existing garage/workshop.
  One meter services both structures.</li>

<li>Water service is provided by Xenia Rural Water
Association.  There is a meter pit
located near the road on the west end of the property and a (I think) 1 inch
line bringing water to the current house. 
The location of this line is clearly visible as it was not well
backfilled and settling has left an obvious depression.</li>

<li>Conditions for waste-water disposal are somewhat
limited.  The county engineer has
indicated that we need to place the septic field behind the existing
house.  This will necessitate a two-tank,
pressure injected system.  The existing
house has a waste disposal system of unknown design and condition.
  We anticipate that at some point in the
future this system may fail and that we would then have to connect the existing
house to the new house’s system.</li>

<li>We expect to keep the existing house for use as rental
property or for relatives for a period of between 5 and 15 years.</li>

<li>While there are two large ash trees in the building
area, neither of these trees is a particularly fine specimen.
  We expect to have to remove these trees to
build the new house.  Other smaller trees
may also have to be removed, but we would like to minimize the affect of
construction on the landscape as much as is practical.</li>

<li>All excess dirt from
excavation can be used on site for more landscaping around the garage,
backfilling the water line trench, and filling low spots.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Space Details</h2>

<h3>Main entrance</h3>

<p>Both our current and previous house have
had less than ideal guest entrances.  Our
previous house had a formal entrance but it was situated and landscaped in such
a way as to make it invisible to approaching visitors while emphasizing the
service entrance.  As a result, only
complete strangers came to the front-door, while friends and family came in
through the back door which drew them through the mud-room, laundry area, and
either the kitchen or a bathroom.  Our
current house is somewhat better, but when guests arrive for a meal, the
obvious (shortest) path is through the laundry and kitchen, while the more
formal path is very circuitous.  From
this experience we know that we want a front entrance that is visible from the
approach to the house, is clearly landscaped to draw visitors in, and places
visitors into the formal rooms of the house, especially the formal living room
and dining areas.  We have seen a number
of houses where the dining area is immediately adjacent to the main entrance
and we do not think this would be best for us as we do not like to have our
meals interrupted when unexpected visitors show up (yes, this even happens in
the country).</p>

<p>The main entrance needs to have space available for guest
coats, hats, boots, and so forth.  It
would be nice to have a place for a guest to sit to remove overshoes.
  We do not need enclosed closet space in this
area, open coat racks, wall pegs, and shelves would be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Another key function of this area is "dog management."
  We have two large dogs who,
while very nice, are also very enthusiastic when greeting visitors.
  We require some way to block the dogs’ access
to the main entrance so as to allow our guests to enter the house unmolested
and meet the dogs in a controlled fashion. 
Our current house does not provide such a barrier and greeting new guests
usually becomes something of a fiasco.</p>

<h3>Formal living room</h3>

<p>Our family values conversation, debate and personal social
contact.  While we are not ‘formal
people’ <i>per se</i>, we want to be able to
interact among ourselves and with our extended family and guest in a quiet
atmosphere without the distraction of television.
  When we welcome guests into our home, we do
not want to welcome them into a room with a blaring T.V.
  We do want to welcome them into a room with
comfortable, attractive seating, an obvious conversational arrangement, a focal
point such as a fireplace, and a nice view to the outside world.</p>

<p>We do not typically entertain large numbers of people,
perhaps six to ten people, including ourselves, at the outside.</p>

<p>Our personal use of the formal living room is as important
to us as is our use of it with guests. 
We enjoy having a room for conversation, playing cards, reading, or
watching a fire or sunset.  We appreciate
having a space that is kept nice—one where we can feel like a guest in our own
home.</p>

<h3>Formal/semi-formal dining room</h3>

<p>We value sitting down together for family meals.
  We especially enjoy after dinner conversation
during family gatherings.  We have lived
in houses both with and without eat-in kitchens.
  In the houses where we had them we used them,
but neither of us sees them as necessary so long as the formal dining area is
adjacent to the kitchen.  In one house we
lived in we enjoyed the eat-in-kitchen area because it had an especially good
view of the yard and better cross ventilation than the formal dining room did.</p>

<h3>Kitchen for one cook</h3>

<p>Lisa is the primary cook in our family.
  Mark helps out some, but is unlikely to
become a partner in the kitchen.  We do
not see the kitchen as a main gathering area, although we do like some degree
of connection between the kitchen and the rest of the house.
  A broad connection between the dining area
and the kitchen would, we think, serve to extend the social space of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>The kitchen is primarily a functional space.
  As such we are always looking for solutions
to the functional problems associated with food preparation: cleaning, trash
handling, recycling bottles and can, storage, etc.</p>

<h3>"Television" or "family" room</h3>

<p>Having implied that we despise television on principle, we
do actually have one and enjoy using it. 
We just don’t use it for background, but rather to watch specific
programs, movies, or sporting events. 
When doing this, we want a very relaxed atmosphere where we can lounge
around like bums.  We may well set up a
card table to play a long running board game or do a puzzle while also watching
an afternoon of basketball.</p>

<p>We see this room as a place that, when cleaned up, is nice
enough to entertain in, but can be left messy without detracting from the rest
of the house’s appeal.</p>

<p>We may also want to have a computer in this room, but we
have not quite figured out what our "post children" computer use patterns will
be.</p>

<h3>Service entrance</h3>

<p>We live in the country; we have big dogs; we do a lot of
projects; we get dirty.  Our service
entrance needs to accommodate bringing in wet and muddy dogs, cleaning them,
and/or leaving them there to dry out. 
This would also be the best location for the dogs’ food and water
dishes.</p>

<p>We have usually considered having this are also serve as our
utility room with washer/dryer, deep freezer, and a utility sink for washing
paint brushes and cleaning up greasy hands.</p>

<p>Clearly proximity to the garage/workshop is important, as is
proximity to the kitchen for accessing the freezer.</p>

<h3>Guest bathroom</h3>

<p>We are not great cleaners, so having one small bathroom for
guests means we only have to really worry about keeping that one clean all the
time.  This is not a feature that we have
ever had in a house and it is one we have always wished we did.</p>

<h3>Home-office</h3>

<p>I work from home full-time as a computer programmer.
  As such, I need a dedicated space for my
work.  In the four years that I have been
working at home, I have discovered that I want to be only partially isolated
from the rest of the house.  When
completely isolated I basically get lonely and bored.
  When I’m in the middle of everything (as I am
now) I have too many distractions (especially if the T.V. is on).</p>

<p>My space requirements include room for a good sized desk (36
inches deep to a wall by approximately 5 feet wide), ample book shelves, some
cabinets and cupboards for concealed storage of media, small equipment, cables,
supplies, etc., a place for a printer, and two or three drawers
worth of filing space.</p>

<p>Lisa also needs office space for her volunteer work and
hobby interests.    It isn’t a
requirement that her office space be in the same room as mine.
  She needs desk space for a computer, two file
drawers and several feet of book shelves.</p>

<h3>Master bedroom.</h3>

<p>We use our bedroom almost exclusively for sleeping and
dressing.  Neither of us have large
collections of clothing, but we do tend toward bulky sweaters and sweatshirts,
so storage for such items is helpful. 
Our preference for storage is toward built-ins over free standing
furniture, but I enjoy building both so we will probably do some of each.</p>

<p>Also, keeping the bedroom
clean has been a point of contention between us, so solutions to the "why can’t
you get your socks in the laundry basket" problem will always be appreciated.</p>

<p>We would like to have room for a fair sized book shelf in
the bedroom as we both enjoy reading at bedtime, and a comfortable chair would
not go amiss.</p>

<h3>Master bathroom</h3>

<p>We tend to get up in the morning and go to bed together, and
we usually shower together.  This means
we want a shower stall large enough for two, and that we need enough space in
the bathroom to move around each other comfortably when washing, shaving,
brushing teeth, etc.  Two sinks would be
nice but are not required.  A tub, in
addition to the shower, would be nice, but is not an absolute requirement (this
may be an option added later).</p>

<h3>Two additional bedrooms</h3>

<p>Large enough for full-sized beds, study areas, reasonable
closets, book shelves, etc.  </p>

<h3>One additional full-bathroom</h3>

<p>The two additional bedrooms can share a bathroom.
  Enough storage space for
towels and two people’s stuff.  Nothing
very special is required here.</p>

<h3>Unfinished space</h3>

<p>We have some indoor hobbies now and will likely have more
when our children are gone.  Currently
this means we need a place for our ping-pong table and a place to start seeds
under grow lights.</p>

<p>Unfinished space is required for bulk storage of such items
as luggage, empty boxes, household supplies, and general junk.
  We do not need a basement workshop area.</p>

<p>I expect to leave the basement unfinished to facilitate
access to mechanicals.</p>

<h2>Relationship to the Site</h2>

<h3>Observations on the site</h3>

<p>We have now lived on the property for nearly two years.
  This has given us the chance to observe the
change of seasons, the patterns of vegetation, light, breezes, and sounds.
  Here are the key points:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The
     site has a very long east-west axis, affording nice views of our "great
     lawn."</li>
 <li>Sunsets
     are spectacular year-round given our slight elevation above the
     surrounding farmland.</li>
 <li>The
     land to the south of us is unlikely to be developed very close because the
     creek and flood plain prohibit building nearby and the City of Ames
     intends to create a green way along the creek.</li>
 <li>We are
     already planning our plantings (especially trees) to provide screens
     against the inevitable development that will occur around us, especially
     to the east and north.</li>
 <li>The
     creek provides a natural point of interest and sunlight reflects off it
     through the trees at various times of the day and year.</li>
 <li>We
     will want to plant trees to the east and west of the house to provide
     shade in the summer.  These trees
     will also harbor birds.</li>
 <li>While
     the site is generally very quiet, a light breeze from the north does bring
     noticeable traffic noise.  This
     noise is almost completely blocked when standing in the lee of the current
     house or garage.</li>
 <li>We
     want to have a series of paths connecting various parts of the property
     and the house.</li>
 <li>The
     creek is a central feature of the property.
       It provides habitat, it defines the wild
     area as separate, it makes noise, it varies from
     day to day.  In short, it is another
     resident.</li>
 <li>We
     will have a neighbor to the south-east, but they are hundreds of yards
     away and they are planting a large windbreak that will screen their house
     from our view.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>The long driveway provides a wonderfully majestic approach
to the house.  While many of the current
trees will be replaced with more diverse species, this will be done gradually
over time.  As you come up the drive you
should spot the entrance to the house from several points so that by the time
you arrive you already know where you are supposed to go.</p>

<p>As virtually everyone will arrive by car, a parking area
must be afforded that will place people near the entrance and in such a way as
to make the path obvious.  Landscaping
will play a key role in accomplishing this.</p>

<p>Access to the garage/workshop area should clearly appear as
a secondary path.</p>

<h3>Porch</h3>

<p>The wrap-around porch is one of the key elements of the
original house that we absolutely want to preserve.
  The porch’s roof line should extend
completely around the house, even if the porch floor and railings transform
into other things, such as a patio or shrubbery.
  Portions of the porch should be screened in
to provide an insect free outdoor area. 
We like the idea of having the roof on the south part of the porch
removable to maximize sun in the winter and minimize it in the summer.</p>

<h3>Patio</h3>

<p>The south side of the house should take advantage
of  natural sun to
make a patio area that is sheltered from the north wind and warms up relatively
early in the year.  This area would also
extend the living area to the outside if it were on the same level as the main
floor (or close).</p>

<h3>Views</h3>

<p>There are no bad views to speak of.
  The very best views are to the west and
south.  The south view is shorter if one
considers only our land, but it is nicely extended by the farm pasture.
  As mentioned earlier, I think this land is
relatively safe from development.</p>

<h3>Cupola</h3>

<p>The cupola provides a panoramic view of the whole
landscape.  It will be interesting to see
just how much we will be able to see from there.</p>

<h3>Service</h3>

<p>Loading/unload of groceries and everyday entrance to the
house will be gained from the east because of the location of the garage.</p>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p>The best way we can describe our desired style is as
"Shaker-Craftsman."  By that we mean a
style based on simple lines, plane surfaces, solid (but not heavy)
construction, warm colors, natural woods, clean, simple hardware.
  We reject heavy ornamentation.
  Specific items that help us depict our idea
include:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Simple
     board casings, with or without a back band.</li>
 <li>Double-hung
     windows with two lights in each sash, divided vertically.</li>
 <li>Interior
     passage doors and cabinet doors made from square edged rails and stile and
     inset with flat panels.</li>
 <li>Built
     in furniture.</li>
 <li>Bead
     board wainscoting and/or porch ceilings.</li>
 <li>Angles
     that emphasize the 45 degree nature of the octagon.
       For instance having the opening from the
     living room to the stair framed with 45 degree corners.</li>
 <li>The
     trim and door wood will be walnut.</li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, I’d quote
Shakespeare’s Polonius "Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not
express'd in fancy; <b>rich,
not gaudy</b>;"</p>

<h2>Other Details &amp; Ideas</h2>

<h3>Maintainability</h3>

<p>I would like the house to be designed with repairs and
upgrades in mind.  To the extent
practical, I would like to keep mechanical systems confined to the stair column
walls and defined chase areas, not just putting them in whatever wall is handy.
  In this way I hope to create a house that is
friendly to remodeling in the future.</p>

<p>I am a fan of access panels so that it is easy to get to
plumbing and HVAC components.</p>

<p>I want my wiring easy to upgrade in the future.</p>
