		<h1>Our Plan</h1>
		<p>It took five years for us to work out how we could interpret the plan of the
		original house from Friendship, NY to suit our needs and desires.  We went through
		hundreds of alternatives and gave up several times, only to come back to it again and
		again.</p>
		<p>The key elements of the original plan that we wanted to preserve were:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The cupola</li>
			<li>The porch</li>
			<li>The center stairway</li>
			<li>The second floor 'hallway' around the central stair</li>
			<li>The position of the master bedroom at the 'end' of the hall way</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In addition to preserving certain key aspects of the original, we had, of course,
		many of our own requirements.  Much of our thinking about what we wanted in a house
		was shaped by the work of Christopher Alexander, author of <i>A Timeless Way of Building</i>,
		<i>A Pattern Language</i>, and many other influential books on architecture and
		building (see <a href='patterns.htm'>Patterns</a> for more on this).  You can also read
		our complete <a href='requirements.htm'>Requirements Document</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>
