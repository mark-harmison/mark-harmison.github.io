<P style="font-size:30px;text-align:center;color:#FF0000">We are now moved in!</P>
<P style="text-align:center;color:#FF0000">On Nov. 4, 2006, we moved into the Octabode and started enjoying the fruits of three years, three months, and three days
of hard work, frustration, spending our life's saving, learning, and laughing.  While there are still many things that need
finishing, we can now rest briefly and take pride in our accomplishment.</P>

<P>Welcome to Octabode.com, the chronicle of our quest to build an
interesting home, mostly by ourselves. The main purpose of this site
is to let our family and friends keep tabs on our progress, view
pictures, read a journal of commentary, and so forth. We hope that
other folks might stumble across this site and find it interesting or
inspiring.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> We update this site as often as we find time and
energy. This means we do it after a hard day of building when we're
tired and sore. If not every word is perfect or every caption
up-to-date, we know you'll understand.</P>
