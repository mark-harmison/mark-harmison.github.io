<H3>Bald Eagle in West Ames!</H3>

<p>These are pictures of our new neighbor.  We hope that they stick around and we'll post pictures as we get them.  It seems to be
that the eagle comes around every three-four days.  I hope to get a picture of the two eagles together but I don't want to scare them away.
If you click on the picture, you'll get a larger image.</p>

eating carion of some kind.  I hope it takes care of a few of the rabbits around here.</td>

You can tell this was taken through a window screen.</td>

Again the window screen is in the way.  I couldn't get the one on the ground due to the willow tree being in the way.  We'll take the screen out of the window now!</td>

<td>January 27.  Hawk and eagle.  The second red tail was the first to try to snatch some food.  It landed about a foot or two away from the eagle, on the same branch.  After a few seconds, the hawk
hops closer to the eagle which raises its wings.  The hawk flew away, landing high in the tree.  When the second hawk tried the same tactic, the eagle flew back to the ash in the pasture.</td>
