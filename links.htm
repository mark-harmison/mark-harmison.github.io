<H2>Suppliers</H2>

<p>I realized as I was writing the little blurbs for each supplier that a common
theme was "good people."  I can't stress this enough.  We shopped around a lot
for all the major items and subcontractors.  We had choices.  While price was always
a consideration, the main thing that sold us over and over again was the attitude
of the people we dealt with.  Too many people in the construction business simply
fail to return phone calls, or treat you like a idiot if you don't know exactly
what you need or how to specify it.  Often, after our initial contract with these
folks was over, I returned to them for additional work and didn't worry about
competitive bids.  Good people and good service pay off.</p>

a very well designed product.</P>

Inventory of Older Octagon, Hexagon, and Round Houses</a></H3>
<P>A large site dedicated to exactly what the title says.  Organized by state.</P>

<h3><a target="_new" href="http://www.dalejtravis.com/">Round Barns & Covered Bridges</a></h3
<p>Another large collection of just what the title says.  The site's author, Dale
Travis, stopped by one afternoon on his way from someplace to someplace else.  We
had a nice visit.  I hope we will stop by again when I have more time and the house
is more finished.  The site is mostly about barns, but for each state there is
also a sizable collection of houses.</p>

<h3><a target="_new" href="http://www.laughingsunrenovations.com/octagon.htm">
Crazy Eight</a></h3>
<p>The owner/builders of this beautiful, under construction octagon got in touch with us
after finding our site on the net.  We have enjoyed sharing each other's experiences and
plans through a series of mail notes.  I am now looking forward to visiting their site
frequently to see it take shape.</p>
